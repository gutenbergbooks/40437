    <p>
      I put together these two dialogues, as distinguished by a marked
      peculiarity. They are the two erotic dialogues of Plato. They have
      one great and interesting subject common to both: though in the
      Ph&aelig;drus, this subject is blended with, and made contributory
      to, another. They agree also in the circumstance, that
      Ph&aelig;drus is, in both, the person who originates the
      conversation. But they differ materially in the manner of
      handling, in the comparisons and illustrations, and in the
      apparent purpose.</p>

        Different sentiment prevalent in Hellenic antiquity and in
        modern times. Position of women in Greece.</span> </p>
    <p>
      The subject common to both is, Love or Eros in its largest sense,
      and with its manifold varieties. Under the totally different vein
      of sentiment which prevails in modern times, and which recognises
      passionate love as prevailing only between persons of different
      sex &#8212; it is difficult for us to enter into Plato&#8217;s eloquent
      exposition of the feeling as he conceives it. In the Hellenic
      point of view,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_1" href="#Footnotev3_26_1"><span
          class="sp">1</span></a> upon which Plato builds, the
      attachment of man to woman was regarded as a natural impulse, and
      as a domestic, social, sentiment; <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page2" id="v3page2"></a>2</span>yet as belonging to a
      common-place rather than to an exalted mind, and seldom or never
      rising to that pitch of enthusiasm which overpowers all other
      emotions, absorbs the whole man, and aims either at the joint
      performance of great exploits or the joint prosecution of
      intellectual improvement by continued colloquy. We must remember
      that the wives and daughters of citizens were seldom seen abroad:
      that the wife was married very young: that she had learnt nothing
      except spinning and weaving: that the fact of her having seen as
      little and heard as little as possible, was considered as
      rendering her more acceptable to her husband:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_2" href="#Footnotev3_26_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      that her sphere of duty and exertion was <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page3" id="v3page3"></a>3</span>confined to the
      interior of the family. The beauty of women yielded satisfaction
      to the senses, but little beyond. It was the masculine beauty of
      youth that fired the Hellenic imagination with glowing and
      impassioned sentiment. The finest youths, and those too of the
      best families and education, were seen habitually uncovered in the
      Pal&aelig;stra and at the public festival-matches; engaged in
      active contention and graceful exercise, under the direction of
      professional trainers. The sight of the living form, in such
      perfection, movement, and variety, awakened a powerful emotional
      sympathy, blended with aesthetic sentiment, which in the more
      susceptible natures was exalted into intense and passionate
      devotion. The terms in which this feeling is described, both by
      Plato and Xenophon, are among the strongest which the language
      affords &#8212; and are predicated even of Sokrates himself. Far from
      being ashamed of the feeling, they consider it admirable and
      beneficial; though very liable to abuse, which they emphatically
      denounce and forbid.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_3"

        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page4" id="v3page4"></a>4</span>view,
      it was an idealising passion, which tended to raise a man above
      the vulgar and selfish pursuits of life, and even above the fear
      of death. The devoted attachments which it inspired were dreaded
      by the despots, who forbade the assemblage of youths for exercise
      in the pal&aelig;stra.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_4"

        Protogenes, illustrate and enlarge upon this Platonic
        construction of Eros &#8212; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#8050; &#7964;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8217; &#8001;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#964;&#8135;

      <p>
        In the Treatise De Educatione Puerorum (c. 15, p. 11 D-F)
        Plutarch hesitates to give a decided opinion on the amount of
        restriction proper to be imposed on youth: he is much impressed
        with the authority of Sokrates, Plato, Xenophon, &AElig;schines,
        Keb&ecirc;s, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#967;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8182;&#957;, &#959;&#7985; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;

        Episthenes, an officer among the Ten Thousand Greeks under
        Xenophon, in Xenophon, Anabasis, vii. 4, 7, and a remarkable
        passage about Zeno the Stoic, Diog. Laert. vii. 13. Respecting
        the general subject of &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#945; in Greece, there is a
        valuable Excursus in Bekker&#8217;s Charikles, vol. i. pp. 347-377,
        Excurs. ii. I agree generally with his belief about the practice
        in Greece, see Cicero, Tusc. Disp. iv. 33, 70. Bekker quotes
        abundant authorities, which might be farther multiplied if
        necessary. In appreciating the evidence upon this point, we
        cannot be too careful to keep in mind what Sokrates says (in the
        Xenophontic Symposion, viii. 34) when comparing the Thebans and
        Eleians on one side with the Athenians and Spartans on the other
        &#8212; &#7960;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#945;, &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;. We must
        interpret passages of the classical authors according to their
        fair and real meanings, not according to the conclusions which
        we might wish to find proved.</p>

        If we read the oration of Demosthenes against Ne&aelig;ra (which

        Neither of these three relations lent itself readily to the
        Platonic vein of sentiment and ideality: neither of them led to
        any grand results either in war &#8212; or political ambition &#8212; or
        philosophical speculation; the three great roads, in one or
        other of which the Grecian ideality travelled. We know from the
        Republic that Plato did not appreciate the value of the family
        life, or the purposes for which men marry, according to the
        above passage cited from Demosthenes. In this point, Plato
        differs from Xenophon, who, in his &#338;conomicus, enlarges much (in
        the discourse of Ischomachus) upon the value of the conjugal
        union, with a view to prudential results and good management of
        the household; while he illustrates the sentimental and
        affectionate side of it, in the story of Pantheia and Abradates
        (Cyrop&aelig;dia).</p>

        The beginning of the Platonic Charmid&ecirc;s illustrates what
        is here said, pp. 154-155; also that of the Protagoras and
        Lysis, pp. 205-206.</p>
      <p>
        Xenophon, Sympos. i. 8-11; iv. 11, 15. Memorab. i. 3, 8-14 (what
        Sokrates observes to Xenophon about Kritobulus).
        Dik&aelig;archus (companion of Aristotle) disapproved the
        important influence which Plato assigned to Eros (Cicero, Tusc.
        D. iv. 34-71).</p>
      <p>
        If we pass to the second century after the Christian Era, we
        find some speakers in Athen&aelig;us blaming severely the
        amorous sentiments of Sokrates and the narrative of Alkibiades,
        as recited in the Platonic Symposium (v. 180-187; xi. 506-508
        C). Athen&aelig;us remarks farther, that Plato, writing in this
        strain, had little right to complain (as we read in the
        Republic) of the licentious compositions of Homer and other
        poets, and to exclude them from his model city. Maximus Tyrius,
        in one of his four discourses (23-5) on the &#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; of Sokrates,
        makes the same remark as Athen&aelig;us about the inconsistency
        of Plato in banishing Homer from the model city, and composing
        what we read in the Symposion; he farther observes that the
        erotic dispositions of Sokrates provoked no censure from his
        numerous enemies at the time (though they assailed him upon so
        many other points), but had incurred great censure from
        contemporaries of Maximus himself, to whom he replies &#8212; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;
        &#957;&#965;&#957;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962; (23, 6-7). The comparisons which he institutes
        (23, 9) between the sentiments and phrases of Sokrates, and
        those of Sappho and Anakreon, are very curious. </p>
      <p>
        Dionysius of Halikarnassus speaks of the &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#974;&#956;&#953;&#945; on Eros in the
        Symposion, as &#8220;unworthy of serious handling or of Sokrates&#8221;. (De
        Admir. Vi Dic. Demosth. p. 1027.)</p>
      <p>
        But the most bitter among all the critics of Plato, is
        Herakleitus &#8212; author of the Allegori&aelig; Homeric&aelig;.
        Herakleitus repels, as unjust and calumnious, the sentence of
        banishment pronounced by Plato against Homer, from whom all
        mental cultivation had been derived. He affirms, and tries to
        show, that the poems of Homer &#8212; which he admits to be full of
        immorality if literally understood &#8212; had an allegorical meaning.
        He blames Plato for not having perceived this; and denounces him
        still more severely for the character of his own writings &#8212;

        stimulus to improving philosophical communion. Personal Beauty,
        the great point of approximation between the world of sense and
        the world of Ideas. Gradual generalisation of the sentiment.</span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Especially to Plato, who combined erotic and poetical imagination
      with Sokratic dialectics and generalising theory &#8212; this passion
      presented itself in the light of a stimulus introductory to the
      work of philosophy &#8212; an impulse at first impetuous and
      undistinguishing, but afterwards regulated towards improving
      communion and colloquy with an improvable youth. Personal beauty
      (this is<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_5" href="#Footnotev3_26_5"><span
          class="sp">5</span></a> the remarkable doctrine of Plato in
      the Ph&aelig;drus) is the main point of visible resemblance
      between the world of sense and the world of Ideas: the Idea of
      Beauty has a brilliant representative of itself among concrete
      objects &#8212; the Ideas of Justice and Temperance have none. The
      contemplation of a beautiful youth, and the vehement emotion
      accompanying it, was the only way of reviving in the soul the Idea
      of Beauty which it had seen in its antecedent stage of existence.
      This was the first stage through which every philosopher must
      pass; but the emotion of love thus raised, became gradually in the
      better minds both expanded and purified. The lover did not merely
      admire the person, but also contracted the strongest sympathy with
      the feelings and character, of the beloved youth: delighting to
      recognise and promote in him all manifestations of mental beauty
      which were in harmony with the physical, so as to raise him to the
      greatest attainable perfection of human nature. The original
      sentiment of admiration, having been thus first transferred by
      association from beauty in the person to beauty in the mind and
      character, became gradually still farther generalised; so that
      beauty was perceived not as exclusively specialised in any one
      individual, but as invested in all beautiful objects, bodies as
      well as minds. The view would presently be farther enlarged. <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page5" id="v3page5"></a>5</span>The
      like sentiment would be inspired, so as to worship beauty in
      public institutions, in administrative arrangements, in arts and
      sciences. And the mind would at last be exalted to the
      contemplation of that which pervades and gives common character to
      all these particulars &#8212; Beauty in the abstract &#8212; or the
      Self-Beautiful &#8212; the Idea or Form of the Beautiful. To reach this
      highest summit, after mounting all the previous stages, and to
      live absorbed in the contemplation of &#8220;the great ocean of the
      beautiful,&#8221; was the most glorious privilege attainable by any
      human being. It was indeed attainable only by a few highly gifted
      minds. But others might make more or less approach to it: and the
      nearer any one approached, the greater measure would he ensure to
      himself of real good and happiness.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_6"

        Secundum ratio cogitat. Tertium mens intuetur. </p>

        divinam idearum ordine infinit&eacute; decorans, Numina deinde
        sequentia mentesque rationum serie complens, Animas tertio

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_4"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_4"></a> All men love Good, as the means of
        Happiness, but they pursue it by various means. The name <i>Eros</i>
        is confined to one special case of this large variety.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such is Plato&#8217;s conception of Eros or Love and its object. He
      represents it as one special form or variety of the universal law
      of gravitation pervading all mankind. Every one loves, desires, or
      aspires to <i>happiness</i>: this is the fundamental or
      primordial law of human nature, beyond which we cannot push
      enquiry. Good, or good things, are nothing else but the means to
      happiness:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_7" href="#Footnotev3_26_7"><span
          class="sp">7</span></a> accordingly, every man, loving
      happiness, loves good also, and desires not only full acquisition,
      but perpetual possession of good. In this wide sense, love belongs
      to all human beings: every man loves good and happiness, with
      perpetual possession of them &#8212; and nothing else.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_8" href="#Footnotev3_26_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
      But different men have different ways of pursuing this same <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page6" id="v3page6"></a>6</span>object.
      One man aspires to good or happiness by way of money-getting,
      another by way of ambition, a third by gymnastics &#8212; or music &#8212; or
      philosophy. Still no one of these is said to love, or to be under
      the influence of Eros. That name is reserved exclusively for one
      special variety of it &#8212; the impulse towards copulation,
      generation, and self-perpetuation, which agitates both bodies and
      minds throughout animal nature. Desiring perpetual possession of
      good, all men desire to perpetuate themselves, and to become
      immortal. But an individual man or animal cannot be immortal: he
      can only attain a quasi-immortality by generating a new individual
      to replace himself.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_9"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> In fact
      even mortal life admits no continuity, but is only a succession of
      distinct states or phenomena: one always disappearing and another
      always appearing, each generated by its antecedent and generating
      its consequent. Though a man from infancy to old age is called the
      same, yet he never continues the same for two moments together,
      either in body or mind. As his blood, flesh, bones, &amp;c., are
      in perpetual disappearance and renovation, always coming and going
      &#8212; so likewise are his sensations, thoughts, emotions,
      dispositions, cognitions, &amp;c. Neither mentally nor physically
      does he ever continue the same during successive instants. The old
      man of this instant perishes and is replaced by a new man during
      the next.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_10" href="#Footnotev3_26_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> As this is true of the individual, so
      it is still more true of the species: continuance or immortality
      is secured only by perpetual generation of new individuals.</p>

        procreation, as the only attainable likeness of immortality,
        requires the sight of personal beauty as an originating
        stimulus.</span></p>
    <p>
      The love of immortality thus manifests itself in living beings
      through the copulative and procreative impulse, which so
      powerfully instigates living man in mind as well as in body.
      Beauty in another person exercises an attractive force which
      enables this impulse to be gratified: ugliness on the contrary
      repels and stifles it. Hence springs the love of beauty &#8212; or
      rather, of procreation in the beautiful &#8212; whereby satisfaction is
      obtained for this restless and impatient agitation.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_11" href="#Footnotev3_26_11"><span
          class="sp">11</span></a> With some, this erotic impulse
      stimulates the body, attracting them towards women, and inducing
      them <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page7" id="v3page7"></a>7</span>to
      immortalise themselves by begetting children: with others, it acts
      far more powerfully on the mind, and determines them to
      conjunction with another mind for the purpose of generating
      appropriate mental offspring and products. In this case as well as
      in the preceding, the first stroke of attraction arises from the
      charm of physical, visible, and youthful beauty: but when, along
      with this beauty of person, there is found the additional charm of
      a susceptible, generous, intelligent mind, the effect produced by
      the two together is overwhelming; the bodily sympathy becoming
      spiritualised and absorbed by the mental. With the inventive and
      aspiring intelligences &#8212; poets like Homer and Hesiod, or
      legislators like Lykurgus and Solon &#8212; the erotic impulse takes
      this turn. They look about for some youth, at once handsome and
      improvable, in conversation with whom they may procreate new
      reasonings respecting virtue and goodness &#8212; new excellences of
      disposition &#8212; and new force of intellectual combination, in both
      the communicants. The attachment between the two becomes so strong
      that they can hardly live apart: so anxious are both of them to
      foster and confirm the newly acquired mental force of which each
      is respectively conscious in himself.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_12"

        impulse in a few privileged minds, when it ascends gradually to
        the love of Beauty <i>in genere</i>. This is the most absorbing
        sentiment of all.</span></p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, and in a few privileged natures, this erotic impulse
      rises to a still higher exaltation, losing its separate and
      exclusive attachment to one individual person, and fastening upon
      beauty in general, or that which all beautiful persons and
      beautiful minds have in common. The visible charm of beautiful
      body, though it was indispensable as an initial step, comes to be
      still farther sunk and undervalued, when the mind has ascended to
      the contemplation of beauty <i>in genere</i>, not merely in
      bodies and minds, but in laws, institutions, and sciences. This is
      the highest pitch of philosophical love, to which a few minds only
      are competent, and that too by successive steps of ascent: but
      which, when attained, is thoroughly soul-satisfying. If any man&#8217;s
      vision be once sharpened so that he can see beauty pure and
      absolute, he will have no eyes for the individual manifestations <span

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_7"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_7"></a> Purpose of the Symposion, to
        contrast this Platonic view of Eros with several different views
        of it previously enunciated by the other speakers; closing with
        a panegyric on Sokrates, by the drunken Alkibiades.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is thus that Plato, in the Symposion, presents Love, or erotic
      impulse: a passion taking its origin in the physical and mental
      attributes common to most men, and concentrated at first upon some
      individual person &#8212; but gradually becoming both more intense and
      more refined, as it ascends in the scale of logical generalisation
      and comes into intimate view of the pure idea of Beauty. The main
      purpose of the Symposion is to contrast this Platonic view of Eros
      or Love &#8212; which is assigned to Sokrates in the dialogue, and is
      repeated by him from the communication of a prophetic woman named
      Diotima<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_15" href="#Footnotev3_26_15"><span
          class="sp">15</span></a> &#8212; with different views assigned to
      other speakers. Each of the guests at the Banquet &#8212; Ph&aelig;drus,
      Pausanias, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, Sokrates &#8212; engages
      to deliver a panegyric on Eros: while Alkibiades, entering
      intoxicated after the speeches are finished, delivers a panegyric
      on Sokrates, in regard to energy and self-denial generally, but
      mainly and specially in the character of Erastes. The pure and
      devoted attachment of Sokrates towards Alkibiades himself &#8212; his
      inflexible self-command under the extreme of trial and temptation
      &#8212; the unbounded ascendancy which he had acquired over that
      insolent youth, who seeks in every conceivable manner to render
      himself acceptable to Sokrates &#8212; are emphatically extolled, and
      illustrated by singular details.</p>

        also 211 D. I cannot but think that &#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; is right. There is

        &#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; is in full keeping with what is said about the special
        religious privileges and revelations of Diotima &#8212; that she
        procured for the Athenians an adjournment of the plague for ten
        years. The Delphian oracle assured the Lydian king Kr&#339;sus that
        Apollo had obtained from the &#924;&#959;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#953; a postponement of the ruin
        of the Lydian kingdom for three years, but that he could obtain
        from them no more (Herodot. i. 91).</p>

      that God as creating within the human bosom by his inspirations
      the noblest self-denial and the most devoted heroism, together

        Sydenham conceives and Boeckh (ad Plat. Legg. iii. 694) concurs
        with him, that this discourse, assigned to Ph&aelig;drus, is
        intended by Plato as an imitation of the style of Lysias. This
        is sufficiently probable. The encomium on Eros delivered by
        Agathon, especially the concluding part of it (p. 197), mimics
        the style of florid effeminate poetry, overcharged with balanced
        phrases (&#7984;&#963;&#972;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#945;, &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#945;), which Aristophanes parodies in
        Agathon&#8217;s name at the beginning of the Thesmophoriazus&aelig;,
        Athen&aelig;us, v. 187 C.</p>

        Respecting this view of Eros or Aphrodite, as a cosmical,

        Incert. 3, 6, assigned by Welcker (Griech. Trag. p. 737) to the
        lost drama &#8212; the first Hippolytus; also the beautiful invocation

          id="Sidenotev3_26_9"></a> Discourse of Sokrates from
        revelation of Diotima. He describes Eros as not a God, but an
        intermediate D&aelig;mon between Gods and men, constantly
        aspiring to divinity, but not attaining it.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates treats most of the preceding panegyrics as pleasing
      fancies not founded in truth. In his representation (cited from
      Diotima) Eros is neither beautiful, nor good, nor happy; nor is he
      indeed a God at all. He is one of the numerous intermediate body
      of D&aelig;mons, inferior to Gods yet superior to men, and serving
      as interpreting agents of communication between the two.<a

      ability and energy, after goodness and beauty, but never actually
      possessing them: a middle condition, preferable to that of the
      person who neither knows that he is deficient in them, nor cares
      to possess them: but inferior to the condition of him who is
      actually in possession. Eros is always Love of something &#8212; in
      relation to something yet unattained, but desired: Eros is to be
      distinguished carefully from the object desired.<a

      because genuine ignorance is unconscious of itself and fancies
      itself to be knowledge: not wise, because he does not possess
      wisdom, and is well aware that he does not possess it. He is in
      the intermediate stage, knowing that he does not possess wisdom,
      but constantly desiring it and struggling after it. Eros, like
      philosophy, represents this continual aspiration and advance
      towards a goal never attained.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_22"

    <p>
      It is thus that the truly Platonic conception of Love is brought
      out, materially different from that of the preceding speakers &#8212;
      Love, as a state of conscious want, and of aspiration or endeavour
      to satisfy that want, by striving after good or happiness &#8212;
      Philosophy as the like intermediate state, in regard to wisdom.
      And Plato follows out this coalescence of love and philosophy in
      the manner which has been briefly sketched above: a vehement
      impulse towards mental communion with some favoured youth, in the
      view of producing mental improvement, good, and happiness to both
      persons concerned: the same impulse afterwards expanding, so as to
      grasp the good and beautiful in a larger sense, and ultimately to
      fasten on goodness and beauty in the pure Idea: which is absolute
      &#8212; independent of time, place, circumstances, and all variable
      elements &#8212; moreover the object of the one and supreme science.<a

        recants in a high-flown panegyric on Eros.</span></p>
    <p>
      I will now compare the Symposion with the Ph&aelig;drus. In the
      first half of the Ph&aelig;drus also, Eros, and the Self-Beautiful
      or the pure Idea of the Beautiful, are brought into close
      coalescence with philosophy and dialectic &#8212; but they are presented
      in a different manner. Plato begins by setting forth the case
      against Eros in two competing discourses (one cited from Lysias,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_24" href="#Footnotev3_26_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> the other pronounced by Sokrates
      himself as competitor with Lysias in eloquence) supposed to be
      addressed to a youth, and intended to convince him that the
      persuasions of a calm and intelligent friend are more worthy of
      being listened to than the exaggerated promises and protestations
      of an impassioned lover, from whom he will receive more injury
      than benefit: that the inspirations of Eros are a sort of madness,
      irrational and misguiding as well as capricious and transitory:
      while the calm and steady friend, unmoved by any passionate
      inspiration, will show himself worthy of permanent esteem and
      gratitude.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_25" href="#Footnotev3_26_25"><span
          class="sp">25</span></a> By a sudden revulsion of feeling,
      Sokrates becomes ashamed of having thus slandered the divine Eros,
      and proceeds to deliver a counter-panegyric or palinode upon that
      God.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_26" href="#Footnotev3_26_26"><span

        Eros, in the Ph&aelig;drus, is pronounced to be a God, son of
        Aphrodit&ecirc; (p. 242 E); in the Symposion he is not a God but
        a D&aelig;mon, offspring of Porus and Penia, and attendant on
        Aphrodit&ecirc;, according to Diotima and Sokrates (p. 203).</p>

        the influence of Eros is a variety of madness, but distinguishes
        good and bad varieties of madness, both coming from the Gods.
        Good madness is far better than sobriety.</span></p>
    <p>
      Eros (he says) is, mad, irrational, superseding reason and
      prudence in the individual mind.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_27"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> This is
      true: yet still Eros exercises a beneficent and improving
      influence. Not all madness is bad. Some varieties of it are bad,
      but others are good. Some arise from human malady, others from the
      inspirations of the Gods: both of them supersede human reason and
      the orthodoxy of established custom<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_28"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> &#8212; but
      the former substitute what is worse, the latter what is better.
      The greatest blessings enjoyed by man arise from madness, when it
      is imparted by divine inspiration. <span class="pagenum"><a

      imparted in four different phases and by four different Gods:

          id="Sidenotev3_26_13"></a> Poetical mythe delivered by
        Sokrates, describing the immortality and pre-existence of the
        soul, and its pre-natal condition of partial companionship with
        Gods and eternal Ideas.</span></p>
    <p>
      Plato then illustrates, by a highly poetical and imaginative
      mythe, the growth and working of love in the soul. All soul or
      mind is essentially self-moving, and the cause of motion to other
      things. It is therefore immortal, without beginning or end: the
      universal or cosmic soul, as well as the individual souls of Gods
      and men.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_31" href="#Footnotev3_26_31"><span
          class="sp">31</span></a> Each soul may be compared to a
      chariot with a winged pair of horses. In the divine soul, both the
      horses are excellent, with perfect wings: in the human soul, one
      only of them is good, the other is violent and rebellious, often
      disobedient to the charioteer, and with feeble or half-grown
      wings.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_32" href="#Footnotev3_26_32"><span
          class="sp">32</span></a> The Gods, by means of their wings,
      are enabled to ascend up to the summit of the celestial firmament
      &#8212; to place themselves upon the outer circumference or back of the
      heaven &#8212; and thus to be carried round along with the rotation of
      the celestial sphere round the Earth. In the course of this
      rotation they contemplate the pure essences and Ideas, truth and
      reality without either form or figure or colour: they enjoy the
      vision of the Absolute &#8212; Justice, Temperance, Beauty, Science. The
      human souls, with their defective wings, try to accompany the
      Gods; some attaching themselves <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page13" id="v3page13"></a>13</span>to one God, some to
      another, in this ascent. But many of them fail in the object,
      being thrown back upon earth in consequence of their defective
      equipment, and the unruly character of one of the horses: some
      however succeed partially, obtaining glimpses of Truth and of the
      general Ideas, though in a manner transient and incomplete.</p>

        experience upon the Intellectual faculties of man &#8212; Comparison
        and combination of particular sensations indispensable &#8212;
        Reminiscence.</span></p>
    <p>
      Those souls which have not seen Truth or general Ideas at all, can
      never be joined with the body of a man, but only with that of some
      inferior animal. It is essential that some glimpse of truth should
      have been obtained, in order to qualify the soul for the condition
      of man:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_33" href="#Footnotev3_26_33"><span
          class="sp">33</span></a> for the mind of man must possess
      within itself the capacity of comparing and combining particular
      sensations, so as to rise to one general conception brought
      together by reason.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_34"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> This is
      brought about by the process of reminiscence; whereby it recalls
      those pure, true, and beautiful Ideas which it had partially seen
      during its prior extra-corporeal existence in companionship with
      the Gods. The rudimentary faculty of thus reviving these general
      Conceptions &#8212; the visions of a prior state of existence &#8212; belongs
      to all men, distinguishing them from other animals: but in most
      men the visions have been transient, and the power of reviving
      them is faint and dormant. It is only some few philosophers, whose
      minds, having been effectively winged in their primitive state for
      ascent to the super-celestial regions, have enjoyed such a full
      contemplation of the divine Ideas as to be able to recall them
      with facility and success, during the subsequent corporeal
      existence. To the reminiscence of the philosopher, these Ideas
      present themselves with such brilliancy and fascination, that he
      forgets all other pursuits and interests. Hence he is set down as
      a madman by the generality of mankind, whose minds have not
      ascended beyond particular and present phenomena to the revival of
      the anterior Ideas.</p>

        soul of the philosopher by the aspect of visible Beauty, which
        is the great link between the world of sense and the world of
        Ideas.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is by the aspect of visible beauty, as embodied in
      distinguished youth, that this faculty of reminiscence is first
      kindled in minds capable of the effort. It is only the embodiment
      of beauty, acting as it does powerfully upon the most intellectual
      of our senses, which has sufficient force to kindle up the first
      act or stage of reminiscence in the mind, leading ultimately to
      the revival of the Idea of Beauty. The embodiments of justice,
      wisdom, temperance, &amp;c., in particular men, do not strike
      forcibly on the senses, nor approximate sufficiently to the
      original Idea, to effect the first stroke of reminiscence in an
      unprepared mind. It is only the visible manifestation of beauty,
      which strikes with sufficient shock at once on the senses and the
      intellect, to recall in the mind an adumbration of the primitive
      Idea of Beauty. The shock thus received first develops the
      reminiscent faculty in minds apt and predisposed to it, and causes
      the undeveloped wings of the soul to begin growing. It is a
      passion of violent and absorbing character; which may indeed take
      a sensual turn, by the misconduct of the unruly horse in the team,
      producing in that case nothing but corruption and mischief &#8212; but
      which may also take a virtuous, sentimental, imaginative turn, and
      becomes in that case the most powerful stimulus towards mental
      improvement in both the two attached friends. When thus refined
      and spiritualised, it can find its satisfaction only in
      philosophical communion, in the generation of wisdom and virtue;
      as well as in the complete cultivation of that reminiscent power,
      which vivifies in the mind remembrance of Forms or Ideas seen in a
      prior existence. To attain such perfection, is given to few; but a
      greater or less approximation may be made to it. And it is the
      only way of developing the highest powers and virtues of the mind;
      which must spring, not from human prudence and sobriety, but from
      divine madness or erotic inspiration.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_35"

        The long and highly poetical mythe, of which I have given some
        of the leading points, occupies from c. 51 to c. 83 (pp.
        244-257) of the dialogue. It is adapted to the Hellenic
        imagination, and requires the reader to keep before him the
        pal&aelig;str&aelig; of Athens, as described in the Lysis,
        Erast&aelig;, and Charmid&ecirc;s of Plato &#8212; visited both by men
        like Sokrates and by men like Kritias (Xenoph. Memor. i. 2, 29).</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page15" id="v3page15"></a>15</span>Such
      is the general tenor of the dialogue Ph&aelig;drus, in its first
      half: which presents to us the Platonic love, conceived as the
      source and mainspring of exalted virtue &#8212; as the only avenue to
      philosophy &#8212; as contrasted, not merely with sensual love, but also
      with the sobriety of the decent citizen who fully conforms to the
      teaching of Law and Custom. In the Symposion, the first of these
      contrasts appears prominently, while the second is less noticed.
      In the Ph&aelig;drus, Sokrates declares emphatically that madness,
      of a certain sort, is greatly preferable to sobriety: that the
      temperate, respectable, orthodox citizen, is on the middle line,
      some madmen being worse than he, but others better: that madness
      springing from human distemper is worse, but that when it springs
      from divine inspiration, it is in an equal degree better, than
      sobriety: that the philosophical <i>&#339;strus</i>, and the
      reminiscence of the eternal Ideas (considered by Plato as the only
      true and real Entia), is inconsistent with that which is esteemed
      as sobriety: and is generated only by special inoculation from
      Eros or some other God. This last contrast, as I have just
      observed, is little marked in the Symposion. But on the other
      hand, the Symposion (especially the discourse of Sokrates and his
      repetition of the lessons of Diotima), insists much more upon the
      generalisation of the erotic impulse. In the Ph&aelig;drus, we
      still remain on the ground of fervent attachment between two
      individuals &#8212; an attachment sentimental and virtuous, displaying
      itself in an intercourse which elicits from both of them active
      intelligence and exalted modes of conduct: in the Symposion, such
      intercourse is assimilated explicitly to copulation with
      procreative consequences, but it is represented as the first stage
      of a passion which becomes more and more expanded and
      comprehensive: dropping all restriction to any single individual,
      and enlarging itself not merely to embrace pursuits, and
      institutions, but also to the plenitude and great ocean of Beauty
      in its largest sense.</p>

    <p>
      The picture here presented by Plato, of the beneficent and
      elevating influence of Eros Philosophus, is repeated by Sokrates
      as a revelation made to him by the prophetess Diotima. It was much
      taken to heart by <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page16"
          id="v3page16"></a>16</span>the Neo-Platonists.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_36" href="#Footnotev3_26_36"><span
          class="sp">36</span></a> It is a striking manifestation of the
      Platonic characteristics: transition from amorous impulse to
      religious and philosophical mysticism &#8212; implication of poetical
      fancy with the conception of the philosophising process &#8212;
      surrender of the mind to metaphor and analogy, which is real up to
      a certain point, but is forcibly stretched and exaggerated to
      serve the theorising purpose of the moment. Now we may observe,
      that the worship of youthful masculine beauty, and the belief that
      contemplation of such a face and form was an operative cause, not
      only raising the admiration but also quickening the intelligence
      of the adult spectator, and serving as a provocative to
      instructive dialogue &#8212; together with a decided attempt to exalt
      the spiritual side of this influence and depreciate the sensual &#8212;
      both these are common to Plato with Sokrates and Xenophon. But
      what is peculiar to Plato is, that he treats this merely as an
      initial point to spring from, and soars at once into the region of
      abstractions, until he gets clear of all particulars and
      concomitants, leaving nothing except Beauty Absolute &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#922;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957; &#8212;
      &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;-&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957; &#8212; the &#8220;full sea of the beautiful&#8221;. Not without
      reason does Diotima express a doubt whether Sokrates (if we mean
      thereby the historical Sokrates) could have followed so bold a
      flight. His wings might probably have failed <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page17" id="v3page17"></a>17</span>and
      dropped him: as we read in the Ph&aelig;drus respecting the
      unprepared souls who try to rise aloft in company with the Gods.
      Plato alone is the true D&aelig;dalus equal to this flight, borne
      up by wings not inferior to those of Pindar<a

        Porphyry, Vit. Plotini, 23.</p>
      <p>
        Plato&#8217;s way of combining, in these two dialogues &#8212; so as to pass
        by an easy thread of association from one to the other &#8212;
        subjects which appear to us unconnected and even discordant, is
        certainly remarkable. We have to recognise material differences
        in the turn of imagination, as between different persons and
        ages. The following remark of Professor Mohl, respecting the
        Persian lyric poet Hafiz, illustrates this point. &#8220;Au reste,
        quand m&ecirc;me nous serions mieux renseign&eacute;s sur sa
        vie, il resterait toujours pour nous le singulier spectacle d&#8217;un
        homme qui tant&ocirc;t c&eacute;l&egrave;bre l&#8217;absorption de
        l&#8217;&acirc;me dans l&#8217;essence de Dieu, tant&ocirc;t chante le vin
        et l&#8217;amour, sans grossi&egrave;ret&eacute;, il est vrai, mais
        avec un laisser aller et un naturel qui exclut toute id&eacute;e
        de symbolisme &#8212; et qui g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement glisse de
        l&#8217;une dans l&#8217;autre de ces deux mani&egrave;res de sentir, qui
        nous paraissent si diff&eacute;rentes, sans s&#8217;apercevoir
        lui-m&ecirc;me qu&#8217;il change de sujet. Les Orientaux ont
        cherch&eacute; la solution de cette difficult&eacute; dans une
        interpr&eacute;tation mystique de toutes ses po&eacute;sies;
        mais les textes s&#8217;y refusent. Des critiques modernes ont voulu
        l&#8217;expliquer en supposant une hypocrisie de l&#8217;auteur, qui lui
        aurait fait m&ecirc;ler une certaine dose de pi&eacute;t&eacute;
        mystique, &agrave; ses vers plus l&eacute;gers, pour les faire
        passer: mais ce calcul parait &eacute;tranger &agrave; la nature
        de l&#8217;homme. Je crois qu&#8217;il faut trouver le mot de
        l&#8217;&eacute;nigme dans l&#8217;&eacute;tat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des
        esprits et de la culture de son temps: et la difficult&eacute;
        pour nous est seulement de nous r&eacute;pr&eacute;senter assez

    <p>Various remarks may be made, in comparing this exposition of
      Diotima in the Symposion with that which we read in the
      Ph&aelig;drus and Ph&aelig;don.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_17"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_17"></a> Differences between Symposion and
        Ph&aelig;drus. In-dwelling conceptions assumed by the former,
        pre-natal experiences by the latter.</span></p>
    <p>
      First, in the Ph&aelig;drus and Ph&aelig;don (also in the
      Tim&aelig;us and elsewhere), the pre-existence of the soul, and
      its antecedent familiarity, greater or less, with the world of
      Ideas, &#8212; are brought into the foreground; so as to furnish a basis
      for that doctrine of reminiscence, which is one of the peculiar
      characteristics of Plato. The Form or Idea, when once disengaged
      from the appendages by which it has been overgrown, is said to be
      recognised by the mind and welcomed as an old acquaintance. But in
      the Symposion, no such doctrine is found. The mind is described as
      rising by gradual steps from the concrete and particular to the
      abstract and general, by recognising the sameness of one attribute
      as pervading many particulars, and by extending its comparisons
      from smaller groups of particulars to larger; until at length one
      and the same attribute is perceived to belong to all. The mind is
      supposed to evolve out of itself, and to generate in some
      companion mind, certain abstract or general conceptions,
      correlating with the Forms or Concepta without. The fundamental
      postulate here is, not that of pre-existence, but that of
      in-dwelling conceptions.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_26_18"></a> Nothing but metaphorical
        immortality recognised in Symposion.</span></p>
    <p>
      Secondly, in the Ph&aelig;drus and Ph&aelig;don, the soul is
      declared to be immortal, <i>&agrave; parte post</i> as well as <i>&agrave;
        parte ante</i>. But in the Symposion, this is affirmed to be
      impossible.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_38" href="#Footnotev3_26_38"><span

      it, a self-renewing series of noble thoughts and <span

    <p>
      Thirdly, in Ph&aelig;drus, Ph&aelig;don, Republic, and elsewhere,
      Plato recognises many distinct Forms or Ideas &#8212; a world or
      aggregate of such Entia Rationis<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_39"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> &#8212; among
      which Beauty is one, but only one. It is the exalted privilege of
      the philosophic mind to come into contemplation and cognition of
      these Forms generally. But in the Symposion, the Form of Beauty
      (&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;) is presented singly and exclusively &#8212; as if the
      communion with this one Form were the sole occupation of the most
      exalted philosophy.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_20"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_20"></a> Eros recognised, both in
        Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion, as affording the initiatory
        stimulus to philosophy &#8212; Not so recognised in Ph&aelig;don,
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, and elsewhere.</span></p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, The Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion have, both of them in
      common, the theory of Eros as the indispensable, initiatory,
      stimulus to philosophy. The spectacle of a beautiful youth is
      considered necessary to set light to various elements in the mind,
      which would otherwise remain dormant and never burn: it enables
      the pregnant and capable mind to bring forth what it has within
      and to put out its hidden strength. But if we look to the
      Ph&aelig;don, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Sophist&ecirc;s, or Republic,
      we shall not find Eros invoked for any such function. The Republic
      describes an elaborate scheme for generating and developing the
      philosophic capacity: but Eros plays no part in it. In the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, the young man so named is announced as
      having a pregnant mind requiring to be disburthened, and great
      capacity which needs foreign aid to develop it: the service needed
      is rendered by Sokrates, who possesses an obstetric patent, and a
      marvellous faculty of cross-examination. Yet instead of any
      auxiliary stimulus arising from personal beauty, the personal
      ugliness of both persons in the dialogue is emphatically
      signified.</p>
    <p>
      I note these peculiarities, partly of the Symposion, partly of the
      Ph&aelig;drus along with it &#8212; to illustrate the varying points of
      view which the reader must expect to meet in travelling through
      the numerous Platonic dialogues.</p>

        Alkibiades in the Symposion &#8212; Behaviour of Sokrates to
        Alkibiades and other handsome youths.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the strange scene with which the Symposion is wound up, the
      main purpose of the dialogue is still farther worked out. The
      spirit and ethical character of Eros Philosophus, after having
      been depicted in general terms by Diotima, are specially
      exemplified in the personal history of Sokrates, as recounted and
      appreciated by Alkibiades. That handsome, high-born, and insolent
      youth, being in a complete state of intoxication, breaks in
      unexpectedly upon the company, all of whom are as yet sober: he
      enacts the part of a drunken man both in speech and action, which
      is described with a vivacity that would do credit to any
      dramatist. His presence is the signal for beginning to drink hard,
      and he especially challenges Sokrates to drink off, after him, as
      much wine as will fill the large water-vessel serving as cooler;
      which challenge Sokrates forthwith accepts and executes, without
      being the least affected by it. Alkibiades instead of following
      the example of the others by delivering an encomium on Eros,
      undertakes to deliver one upon Sokrates. He proceeds to depict
      Sokrates as the votary of Eros Philosophus, wrapped up in the
      contemplation of beautiful youths, and employing his whole time in
      colloquy with them &#8212; yet as never losing his own self-command,
      even while acquiring a magical ascendency over these companions.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_40" href="#Footnotev3_26_40"><span
          class="sp">40</span></a> The abnormal exterior of Sokrates,
      resembling that of a Satyr, though concealing the image of a God
      within &#8212; the eccentric pungency of his conversation, blending
      banter with seriousness, homely illustrations with impressive
      principles &#8212; has exercised an influence at once fascinating,
      subjugating, humiliating. The impudent Alkibiades has been made to
      feel painfully his own unworthiness, even while receiving every
      mark of admiration from others. He has become enthusiastically
      devoted to Sokrates, whom he has sought to attach to himself, and
      to lay under obligation, by tempting offers of every kind. The
      details of these offers are given with a fulness which cannot be
      translated to modern readers, and which even then required to be
      excused as the revelations of a drunken man. They present one of
      the boldest fictions in the Greek language &#8212; if we look at them in
      conjunction with the real character of <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page20" id="v3page20"></a>20</span>Alkibiades as an
      historical person.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_41"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> Sokrates
      is found proof against every variety of temptation, however
      seductive to Grecian feeling. In his case, Eros Philosophus
      maintains his dignity as exclusively pure, sentimental, and
      spiritual: while Alkibiades retires more humiliated than ever. We
      are given to understand that the like offers had been made to
      Sokrates by many other handsome youths also &#8212; especially by
      Charmides and Euthydemus &#8212; all of them being treated with the same
      quiet and repellent indifference.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_42"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> Sokrates
      had kept on the vantage-ground as regards all:&#8212; and was regarded

        to overcome the continence of Xenokrates, Diog. L. iv. 7: and
        the saying of Lais, &#8033;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#960;&#8217; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#972;&#962;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217; &#7936;&#960;&#8217; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;,

        description given by Alkibiades &#8212; as the maximum of testimony to
        the &#8220;invicta continentia&#8221; of Sokrates &#8212; with the testimony to
        the surpassing beauty of Helen, borne by such witnesses as the

        of the speakers in Athen&aelig;us censures severely this portion
        of the Platonic Symposion, xi. 506 C, 508 D, v. 187 D. Porphyry

        delivered an apology for Alkibiades, in the presence of

    <p>
      Not merely upon this point but upon others also, Alkibiades
      recounts anecdotes of the perfect self-mastery of Sokrates: in
      endurance of cold, heat, hunger, and fatigue &#8212; in contempt of the
      dangers of war, in bravery on the day of battle &#8212; even in the
      power of bearing more wine than any one else, without being
      intoxicated, whenever the occasion was such as to require him to
      drink: though he never drank much willingly. While all his
      emotions are thus described as under the full control of Reason
      and Eros Philosophus &#8212; his special gift and privilege was that of

        In the Xenophontic Apology (s. 18), Sokrates adverts to the
        undisturbed equanimity which he had shown during the long
        blockade of Athens after the battle of &AElig;gospotami, while
        others were bewailing the famine and other miseries.</p>

        of the Symposion &#8212; Sokrates is not affected by it, but continues
        his dialectic process.</span></p>
    <p>
      After the speech of Alkibiades is concluded, the close of the
      banquet is described by the primary narrator. He himself, with
      Agathon and Aristophanes, and several other fresh revellers,
      continue to drink wine until all of them become dead drunk. While
      Ph&aelig;drus, Eryximachus, and others retire, Sokrates remains.
      His competency to bear the maximum of wine without being disturbed
      by it, is tested to the full. Although he had before, in
      acceptance of the challenge of Alkibiades, swallowed the contents
      of the wine cooler, he nevertheless continues all the night to
      drink wine in large bowls, along with the rest. All the while,
      however, he goes on debating his ordinary topics, even though no
      one is sufficiently sober to attend to him. His companions
      successively fall asleep, and at day-break, he finds himself the
      only person sober,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_44"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> except
      Aristodemus (the narrator of the whole scene), who has recently
      waked after a long sleep. Sokrates quits the house of Agathon,
      with unclouded senses and undiminished activity &#8212; bathes &#8212; and
      then visits the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page22"
          id="v3page22"></a>22</span>gymnasium at the Lykeion; where he
      passes all the day in his usual abundant colloquy.<a

        In Sympos. p. 176 B, Sokrates is recognised as &#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;
        &#960;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;, above all the rest: no one can be compared with him. In
        the two first books of the Treatise De Legibus, we shall find
        much to illustrate what is here said (in the Symposion) about
        the power ascribed to him of drinking more wine than any one
        else, without being at all affected by it. Plato discusses the
        subject of strong potations (&#956;&#941;&#952;&#951;) at great length; indeed he
        seems to fear that his readers will think he says too much upon
        it (i. 642 A). He considers it of great advantage to have a test
        to apply, such as wine, for the purpose of measuring the reason
        and self-command of different men, and of determining how much
        wine is sufficient to overthrow it, in each different case (i.
        649 C-E). You can make this trial (he argues) in each case,
        without any danger or harm; and you can thus escape the
        necessity of making the trial in a real case of emergency. Plato
        insists upon the &#967;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#956;&#941;&#952;&#951;&#962;, as a genuine test, to be
        seriously employed for the purpose of testing men&#8217;s reason and
        force of character (ii. p. 673). In the Republic, too (iii. p.
        413 E), the &#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962; are required to be tested, in regard to
        their capacity of resisting pleasurable temptation, as well as
        pain and danger.</p>
      <p>
        Among the titles of the lost treatises of Theophrastus, we find
        one &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#924;&#941;&#952;&#951;&#962; (Diog. L. v. 44). It is one of the compliments
        that the Emperor Marcus Antoninus (i. 16) pays to his father &#8212;
        That he was, like Sokrates, equally competent both to partake
        of, and to abstain from, the most seductive enjoyments, without
        ever losing his calmness and self-mastery.</p>

        is the antithesis and complement of the other.</span></p>
    <p>
      The picture of Sokrates, in the Symposion, forms a natural
      contrast and complement to the picture of him in the Ph&aelig;don;
      though the conjecture of Schleiermacher<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_46"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> &#8212; that
      the two together are intended to make up the Philosophus, or third
      member of the trilogy promised in the Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; is
      ingenious rather than convincing. The Ph&aelig;don depicts
      Sokrates in his last conversation with his friends, immediately
      before his death; the Symposion presents him in the exuberance of
      life, health, and cheerfulness: in both situations, we find the
      same attributes manifested &#8212; perfect equanimity and self-command,
      proof against every variety of disturbing agency &#8212; whether
      tempting or terrible &#8212; absorbing interest in philosophical
      dialectic. The first of these two elements, if it stood alone,
      would be virtuous sobriety, yet not passing beyond the limit of
      mortal virtue: the last of the two superadds a higher element,
      which Plato conceives to transcend the limit of mortal virtue, and
      to depend upon divine inspiration or madness.<a

        that of Xenophon.</span></p>
    <p>
      The Symposion of Plato affords also an interesting subject of
      comparison with that of his contemporary Xenophon, as to points of
      agreement as well as of difference.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_48"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> Xenophon
      states in the beginning that he intends to describe what passed in
      a scene where he himself was <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page23" id="v3page23"></a>23</span>present; because he
      is of opinion that the proceedings of excellent men, in hours of
      amusement, are not less worthy of being recorded than those of
      their serious hours. Both Plato and Xenophon take for their main
      subject a festive banquet, destined to celebrate the success of a
      young man in a competitive struggle. In Plato, the success is one
      of mind and genius &#8212; Agathon has gained the prize of tragedy: in
      Xenophon, it is one of bodily force and skill &#8212; Autolykus victor
      in the pankration. The Symposion of Xenophon differs from that of
      Plato, in the same manner as the Memorabilia of Xenophon generally
      differ from the Sokratic dialogues of Plato &#8212; that is, by
      approaching much nearer to common life and reality. It describes a
      banquet such as was likely enough to take place, with the usual
      accompaniments &#8212; a professional jester, and a Syracusan
      ballet-master who brings with him a dancing-girl, a girl to play
      on the flute and harp, and a handsome youth. These artists
      contribute to the amusement of the company by music, dancing,
      throwing up balls and catching them again, jumping into and out of
      a circle of swords. All this would have occurred at an ordinary
      banquet: here, it is accompanied and followed by remarks of
      pleasantry, buffoonery and taunt, interchanged between the guests.
      Nearly all the guests take part, more or less: but Sokrates is
      made the prominent figure throughout. He repudiates the offer of
      scented unguents: but he recommends the drinking of wine, though
      moderately, and in small cups. The whole company are understood to
      be somewhat elevated with wine, but not one of them becomes
      intoxicated. Sokrates not only talks as much fun as the rest, but
      even sings, and speaks of learning to dance, jesting on his own
      corpulence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_49" href="#Footnotev3_26_49"><span
          class="sp">49</span></a> Most part of the scene is broad
      farce, in the manner, though not with all the humour, of

          class="sp">50</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page24" id="v3page24"></a>24</span>The number and
      variety of the persons present is considerable, greater than in
      most of the Aristophanic plays.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_51"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> Kallias,
      Lykon, Autolykus, Sokrates, Antisthenes, Hermogenes, Nikeratus,
      Kritobulus, have each his own peculiarity: and a certain amount of
      vivacity and amusement arises from the way in which each of them
      is required, at the challenge of Sokrates, to declare on what it
      is that he most prides himself. Sokrates himself carries the
      burlesque farther than any of them; pretending to be equal in
      personal beauty to Kritobulus, and priding himself upon the
      function of a pander, which he professes to exercise. Antisthenes,
      however, is offended, when Sokrates fastens upon him a similar
      function: but the latter softens the meaning of the term so as to
      appease him. In general, each guest is made to take pride in
      something the direct reverse of that which really belongs to him;
      and to defend his thesis in a strain of humorous parody.
      Antisthenes, for example, boasts of his wealth. The Syracusan
      ballet-master is described as jealous of Sokrates, and as
      addressing to him some remarks of offensive rudeness; which
      Sokrates turns off, and even begins to sing, for the purpose of
      preventing confusion and ill-temper from spreading among the
      company:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_52" href="#Footnotev3_26_52"><span
          class="sp">52</span></a> while he at the same time gives
      prudent advice to the Syracusan about the exhibitions likely to be
      acceptable.</p>

        Pontianus, one of the speakers in Athen&aelig;us (xi. 504),
        touches upon some points of this comparison, with a view of
        illustrating the real or supposed enmity between Plato and
        Xenophon; an enmity not in itself improbable, yet not
        sufficiently proved. </p>
      <p>
        Athen&aelig;us had before him the Symposion of Epikurus (not
        preserved) as well as those of Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle
        (xv. 674); and we learn from him some of its distinctive points.
        Masurius (the speaker in Athen&aelig;us, v. init.) while he
        recognises in the Symposia of Xenophon and Plato a dramatic
        variety of characters and smartness &#8212; finds fault with both, but
        especially with Plato, for levity, rudeness, indecency,
        vulgarity, sneering, &amp;c. The talk was almost entirety upon
        love and joviality. In the Symposion of Epikurus, on the
        contrary, nothing was said about these topics; the guests were
        fewer, the conversation was grave and dull, upon dry topics of
        science, such as the atomic theory (&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#7936;&#964;&#972;&#956;&#969;&#957;, v. 3, 187
        B, 177 B. &#7960;&#960;&#943;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#969;&#957; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;), and
        even upon bodily ailments, such as indigestion or fever (187 C).
        The philosophers present were made by Epikurus to carry on their
        debate in so friendly a spirit, that the critic calls them
        &#8220;flatterers praising each other&#8221;; while he terms the Platonic
        guests &#8220;sneerers insulting each other&#8221; (&#956;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;
        &#964;&#969;&#952;&#945;&#950;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, 182 A), though this is much more true about the
        Xenophontic Symposion than about the Platonic. He remarks
        farther that the Symposion of Epikurus included no libation or
        offering to the Gods (179 D).</p>
      <p>
        It is curious to note these peculiarities in the compositions
        (now lost) of a philosopher like Epikurus, whom many historians
        of philosophy represent as thinking about nothing but convivial
        and sexual pleasure.</p>

        Xen. Symp. viii. 24. The argument against the sensual is
        enforced with so much warmth that Sokrates is made to advert to
        the fact of his being elate with wine &#8212; &#8005; &#964;&#949; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#959;&#7990;&#957;&#959;&#962;

        The contrast between the customs of the Thebans and Eleians, and
        those of the Laced&aelig;monians, is again noted by Xenophon,
        Rep. Laced. ii. 13. Plato puts (Symp. 182) a like contrast into
        the mouth of Pausanias, assimilating the customs of Athens in
        this respect to those of Sparta. The comparison between Plato
        and Xenophon is here curious; we see how much more copious and
        inventive is the reasoning of Plato.</p>

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page25" id="v3page25"></a>25</span>The
      Xenophontic Symposion closes with a pantomimic scene of Dionysus
      and Ariadn&ecirc; as lovers represented (at the instance of
      Sokrates) by the Syracusan ballet-master and his staff. This is
      described as an exciting spectacle to most of the hearers, married
      as well as unmarried, who retire with agreeable emotions. Sokrates
      himself departs with Lykon and Kallias, to be present at the
      exercise of Autolykus.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_55"

        Xen. Symp. viii. 5, ix. 7. The close of the Xenophontic
        Symposion is, to a great degree, in harmony with modern
        sentiment, though what is there expressed would probably be left
        to be understood. The Platonic Symposion departs altogether from
        that sentiment.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_26_27"></a> Platonic Symposion more ideal and
        transcendental than the Xenophontic.</span></p>
    <p>
      We see thus that the Platonic Symposion is much more ideal, and
      departs farther from common practice and sentiment, than the
      Xenophontic. It discards all the common accessories of a banquet
      (musical or dancing artists), and throws the guests altogether
      upon their own powers of rhetoric and dialectic, for amusement. If
      we go through the different encomiums upon Eros, by Ph&aelig;drus,
      Pausanias, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, Diotima &#8212; we shall
      appreciate the many-coloured forms and exuberance of the Platonic
      imagination, as compared with the more restricted range and
      common-place practical sense of Xenophon.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_56" href="#Footnotev3_26_56"><span
          class="sp">56</span></a> All the Platonic speakers are
      accomplished persons &#8212; a man of letters, a physician, two
      successful poets, a prophetess: the Xenophontic personages, except
      Sokrates and Antisthenes, are persons of ordinary capacity. The
      Platonic Symposion, after presenting Eros in five different points
      of view, gives pre-eminence and emphasis to a sixth, in which Eros
      is regarded as the privileged minister and conductor to the
      mysteries of philosophy, both the lowest and the highest: the
      Xenophontic Symposion dwells upon one view only of Eros (developed
      by Sokrates) and cites Kallias as example of it, making no mention
      of philosophy. The Platonic Symposion exalts Sokrates, as the
      representative of Eros Philosophus, to a pinnacle of elevation
      which places him above human fears and weaknesses<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_57" href="#Footnotev3_26_57"><span
          class="sp">57</span></a> &#8212; coupled however with that <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page26" id="v3page26"></a>26</span>eccentricity
      which makes the vulgar regard a philosopher as out of his mind:
      the Xenophontic Symposion presents him only as a cheerful, amiable
      companion, advising temperance, yet enjoying a convivial hour, and
      contributing more than any one else to the general hilarity.</p>

      Such are the points of comparison which present themselves between
      the same subject as handled by these two eminent contemporaries,
      both of them companions, and admirers of Sokrates: and each
      handling it in his own manner.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_58"

        Which of these two Symposia was the latest in date of
        composition we cannot determine with certainty: though it seems
        certain that the latest of the two was not composed in imitation
        of the earliest. </p>
      <p>
        From the allusion to the &#948;&#953;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; of Mantineia (p. 193 A) we
        know that the Platonic Symposion must have been composed after
        385 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>: there is great probability
        also, though not full certainty, that it was composed during the
        time when Mantineia was still an aggregate of separate villages
        and not a town &#8212; that is, between 385-370 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
        in which latter year Mantineia was re-established as a city. The
        Xenophontic Symposion affords no mark of date of composition:
        Xenophon reports it as having been himself present. It does
        indeed contain, in the speech delivered by Sokrates (viii. 32),
        an allusion to, and a criticism upon, an opinion supported by
        Pausanias &#8001; &#7944;&#947;&#940;&#952;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962;, who discourses in the
        Platonic Symposion: and several critics think that this is an
        allusion by Xenophon to the Platonic Symposion. I think this
        opinion improbable. It would require us to suppose that Xenophon
        is inaccurate, since the opinion which he ascribes to Pausanias
        is not delivered by Pausanias in the Platonic Symposion, but by
        Ph&aelig;drus. Athen&aelig;us (v. 216) remarks that the opinion
        is not delivered by Pausanias, but he does not mention that it <i>is</i>
        delivered by Ph&aelig;drus. He remarks that there was no known
        written composition of Pausanias himself: and he seems to
        suppose that Xenophon must have alluded to the Platonic
        Symposion, but that he quoted it inaccurately or out of another
        version of it, different from what we now read. Athen&aelig;us
        wastes reasoning in proving that the conversation described in
        the Platonic Symposion cannot have really occurred at the time
        to which Plato assigns it. This is unimportant: the speeches are
        doubtless all composed by Plato. If Athen&aelig;us was anxious
        to prove anachronism against Plato, I am surprised that he did
        not notice that of the &#948;&#953;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; of Mantineia mentioned in a
        conversation supposed to have taken place in the presence of
        Sokrates, who died in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>
      <p>
        I incline to believe that the allusion of Xenophon is not
        intended to apply to the Symposion of Plato. Xenophon ascribes
        one opinion to Pausanias, Plato ascribes another; this is noway
        inconceivable. I therefore remain in doubt whether the
        Xenophontic or the Platonic Symposion is earliest. Compare the
        Pr&aelig;f. of Schneider to the former, pp. 140-143.</p>

      I have already stated that the first half of the Ph&aelig;drus
      differs materially from the second; and that its three discourses
      on the subject of Eros (the first two depreciating Eros, the third
      being an effusion of high-flown and poetical panegyric on the same
      theme) may be better understood by being looked at in conjunction
      with the Symposion. The second half of the Ph&aelig;drus passes
      into a different discussion, criticising the discourse of Lysias
      as a rhetorical composition: examining the principles upon which
      the teaching of Rhetoric as an Art either <span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      I heard one of our active political citizens (says Ph&aelig;drus)
      severely denounce Lysias, and fasten upon him with contempt, many
      times over, the title of a logographer. Active politicians will
      not consent to compose and leave behind them written discourses,

        The two appellations &#8212; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962; and &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962; &#8212; are here
        coupled together as terms of reproach, just as they stand
        coupled in Demosthenes, Fals. Leg. p. 417. It is plain that both
        appellations acquired their discreditable import mainly from the
        collateral circumstance that the persons so denominated took
        money for their compositions or teaching. The &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962; wrote
        for pay, and on behalf of any client who could pay him. In the
        strict etymological sense, neither of the two terms would imply
        any reproach.</p>
      <p>
        Yet Plato, in this dialogue, when he is discussing the worth of
        the reproachful imputation fastened on Lysias, takes the term
        &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962; only in this etymological, literal sense, omitting to
        notice the collateral association which really gave point to it
        and made it serve the purpose of a hostile speaker. This is the
        more remarkable, because we find Plato multiplying
        opportunities, even on unsuitable occasions, of taunting the
        Sophists with the fact that they took money. Here in the
        Ph&aelig;drus, we should have expected that if he noticed the
        imputation at all, he would notice it in the sense intended by
        the speaker. In this sense, indeed, it would not have suited the
        purpose of his argument, since he wishes to make it an
        introduction to a philosophical estimate of the value of writing
        as a means of instruction.</p>
      <p>
        Heindorf observes, that Plato has used a similar liberty in
        comparing the &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962; to the proposer of a law or decree.

      He may persuade the people under these circumstances (replies

      and unjust, good and evil, &amp;c. There can be no genuine art of
      speaking, which is not founded upon knowledge of the truth, and
      upon adequate philosophical comprehension of the subject-matter.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_63" href="#Footnotev3_26_63"><span
          class="sp">63</span></a> The rhetorical teachers take too
      narrow a view of rhetoric, when they confine it to public
      harangues addressed to the assembly or to the Dikastery. Rhetoric
      embraces all guidance of the mind through words, whether in public
      harangue or private conversation, on matters important or trivial.
      Whether it be a controversy between two litigants in a Dikastery,
      causing the Dikasts to regard the same matters now as being just
      and good, presently as being unjust and evil: or between two
      dialecticians like Zeno, who could make his hearers view the same
      subjects as being both like and unlike &#8212; both one and many &#8212; both
      in motion and at rest: in either case the art (if there be any
      art) and its principles are the same. You ought to assimilate
      every thing to every thing, in all cases where assimilation is
      possible: if your adversary assimilates in like manner, concealing
      the process from his hearers, you must convict and expose his
      proceedings. Now the possibility or facility of deception in this
      way will depend upon the extent of likeness between things. If
      there be much real likeness, deception is easy, and one of them
      may easily be passed off as the other: if there be little
      likeness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page29" id="v3page29"></a>29</span>deception
      will be difficult. An extensive acquaintance with the real
      resemblances of things, or in other words with truth, constitutes
      the necessary basis on which all oratorical art must proceed.<a

        the discourse of Lysias and his own. Eros is differently
        understood: Sokrates defined what he meant by it: Lysias did not
        define.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates then compares the oration of Lysias with his own two
      orations (the first depreciating, the second extolling, Eros) in
      the point of view of art; to see how far they are artistically
      constructed. Among the matters of discourse, there are some on
      which all men are agreed, and on which therefore the speaker may
      assume established unanimity in his audience: there are others on
      which great dissension and discord prevail. Among the latter (the
      topics of dissension), questions about just and unjust, good and
      evil, stand foremost:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_65"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> it is
      upon these that deception is most easy, and rhetorical skill most
      efficacious. Accordingly, an orator should begin by understanding
      to which of these two categories the topic which he handles
      belongs: If it belongs to the second category (those liable to
      dissension) he ought, at the outset, to define what he himself
      means by it, and what he intends the audience to understand. Now
      Eros is a topic on which great dissension prevails. It ought
      therefore to have been defined at the commencement of the
      discourse. This Sokrates in his discourse has done: but Lysias has
      omitted to do it, and has assumed Eros to be obviously and
      unanimously apprehended by every one. Besides, the successive
      points in the discourse of Lysias do not hang together by any
      thread of necessary connection, as they ought to do, if the
      discourse were put together according to rule.<a

        Division &#8212; both of them exemplified in the two discourses of
        Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>
      Farthermore, in the two discourses of Sokrates, not merely was the
      process of <i>logical definition</i> exemplified in the case of
      Eros &#8212; but also the process of <i>logical division</i>, in the
      case of Madness or Irrationality. This last extensive genus was
      divided first into two species &#8212; Madness, from human distemper &#8212;
      Madness, from divine inspiration, carrying a man out of the
      customary orthodoxy.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_67"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Next,
      this last species was again divided into <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page30" id="v3page30"></a>30</span>four branches or
      sub-species, according to the God from whom the inspiration
      proceeded, and according to the character of the inspiration &#8212; the
      prophetic, emanating from Apollo &#8212; the ritual or mystic, from
      Dionysus &#8212; the poetic, from the Muses &#8212; the amatory, from Eros and
      Aphrodit&ecirc;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_68"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> Now both
      these processes, definition and division, are familiar to the true
      dialectician or philosopher: but they are not less essential in
      rhetoric also, if the process is performed with genuine art. The
      speaker ought to embrace in his view many particular cases, to
      gather together what is common to all, and to combine them into
      one generic concept, which is to be embodied in words as the
      definition. He ought also to perform the counter-process: to
      divide the genus not into parts arbitrary and incoherent (like a
      bad cook cutting up an animal without regard to the joints) but
      into legitimate species;<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_69"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> each
      founded on some positive and assignable characteristic. &#8220;It is
      these divisions and combinations (says Sokrates) to which I am
      devotedly attached, in order that I may become competent for
      thought and discourse: and if there be any one else whom I
      consider capable of thus contemplating the One and the Many as
      they stand in nature &#8212; I follow in the footsteps of that man as in
      those of a God. I call such a man, rightly or wrongly, a
      Dialectician.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_70" href="#Footnotev3_26_70"><span

    <p>
      What else is there worth having (says Sokrates), which these

      first, the exordium, then recital, proof, second proof,
      refutation, recapitulation at the close: advice how to introduce
      maxims or similes: receipts for moving the anger or compassion of
      the dikasts. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page31"

        name="FnAnchorv3_26_71" href="#Footnotev3_26_71"><span
          class="sp">71</span></a> but it is not the art of rhetoric. It

      a man can acquire the art: but it is not the art itself. You must

      employ these accomplishments:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_72"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
      otherwise you have not learnt the art of rhetoric. You may just as
      well consider yourself a physician because you know how to bring
      about vomit and purging &#8212; or a musician, because you know how to
      wind up or unwind the chords of your lyre. These teachers mistake
      the preliminaries or antecedents of the art, for the art itself.
      It is in the right, measured, seasonable, combination and
      application of these preliminaries, in different doses adapted to
      each special matter and audience &#8212; that the art of rhetoric
      consists. And this is precisely the thing which the teacher does
      not teach, but supposes the learner to acquire for himself.<a

    <p>
      The true art of rhetoric (continues Sokrates) embraces a larger
      range than these teachers imagine. It deals with mind, as the
      medical researches of Hippokrates deal with body &#8212; as a generic
      total with all its species and varieties, and as essentially
      relative to the totality of external circumstances. First,
      Hippokrates investigates how far the body is, in every particular
      man, simple, homogeneous, uniform: and how far it is complex,
      heterogeneous, multiform, in the diversity of individuals. If it
      be one and the same, or in so far as it is one and the same, he
      examines what are its properties in relation to each particular
      substance acting upon it or acted upon by it. In so far as it is
      multiform and various, he examines and compares each of the
      different varieties, in the same manner, to ascertain its
      properties in relation to every substance.<a

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_36"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_36"></a> Art of Rhetoric ought to include a
        systematic classification of minds with all their varieties, and
        of discourses with all their varieties. The Rhetor must know how
        to apply the one to the other, suitably to each particular case.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now the true rhetor ought to deal with the human mind in like
      manner. His task is to work persuasion in the minds of certain men
      by means of discourse. He has therefore, first, to ascertain how
      far all mind is one and the same, and what are the affections
      belonging to it universally in relation to other things: next, to
      distinguish the different varieties of minds, together with the
      properties, susceptibilities, and active aptitudes, of each:
      carrying the subdivision down until he comes to a variety no
      longer admitting division.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_75"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> He must
      then proceed to distinguish the different varieties of discourse,
      noting the effects which each is calculated to produce or to
      hinder, and the different ways in which it is likely to impress
      different minds.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_76"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> Such and
      such men are persuadable by such and such discourses &#8212; or the
      contrary. Having framed these two general classifications, the
      rhetor must on each particular occasion acquire a rapid tact in
      discerning to which class of minds the persons whom he is about to
      address belong: and therefore what class of discourses will be
      likely to operate on them persuasively.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_77"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> He must
      farther know those subordinate artifices of speech on which the

      and limit within which each can be safely employed.<a

        become possessed of real truth, as well as that which his
        auditors believe to be truth. He is not sufficiently rewarded
        for this labour.</span></p>
    <p>
      Nothing less than this assemblage of acquirements (says Sokrates)
      will suffice to constitute a real artist, either in speaking or
      writing. Arduous and fatiguing indeed the acquisition is: but
      there is no easier road. And those who tell us that the rhetor
      need not know what is really true, but only what his audience will
      believe to be true &#8212; must be reminded that this belief, on the
      part of the audience, arises from the likeness of that which they
      believe, to the real truth. Accordingly, he who knows the real
      truth will be cleverest in suggesting apparent or quasi-truth
      adapted to their feelings. If a man is bent on becoming an artist
      in rhetoric, he must go through the process here marked out: yet
      undoubtedly the process is so laborious, that rhetoric, when he
      has acquired it, is no adequate reward. We ought to learn how to
      speak and act in a way agreeable to the Gods, and this is worth
      all the trouble necessary for acquiring it. But the power of
      speaking agreeably and effectively to men, is not of sufficient
      moment to justify the expenditure of so much time and labour.<a

        for the purpose of instruction, it can do little &#8212; Reasons why.
        Writing may remind the reader of what he already knows.</span></p>
    <p>
      We have now determined what goes to constitute genuine art, in
      speaking or in writing. But how far is writing, even when art is
      applied to it, capable of producing real and permanent effect? or
      indeed of having art applied to it at all? Sokrates answers
      himself &#8212; Only to a small degree. Writing will impart amusement
      and satisfaction for the moment: it will remind the reader of
      something which he knew before, if he really did know. But in
      respect to any thing which he did not know before, it will neither
      teach nor persuade him: it may produce in him an impression or
      fancy that he is wiser than he was before, but such impression is
      illusory, and at best only transient. Writing is like painting &#8212;
      one and the same to all readers, whether young or old, well or ill
      informed. It cannot adapt itself to the different state of mind of
      different persons, as we have declared that every finished speaker
      ought to do. It cannot answer questions, supply deficiencies,
      reply to objections, rectify misunderstanding. It is <span

      This blending of philosophy with rhetoric, which pervades the
      criticisms on Lysias in the Ph&aelig;drus, is farther illustrated
      by the praise bestowed upon Isokrates in contrast with Lysias.
      Isokrates occupied that which Plato in Euthyd&ecirc;mus calls &#8220;the
      border country between philosophy and politics&#8221;. Many critics
      declare (and I think with probable reason<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_86" href="#Footnotev3_26_86"><span
          class="sp">86</span></a>) that Isokrates is the person
      intended (without being named) in the passage just cited from the
      Euthyd&ecirc;mus. In the Ph&aelig;drus, Isokrates is described as
      the intimate friend of Sokrates, still young; and is pronounced
      already superior in every way to Lysias &#8212; likely to become
      superior in future to all the rhetors that have ever flourished &#8212;
      and destined probably to arrive even at the divine mysteries of
      philosophy.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_87" href="#Footnotev3_26_87"><span

        Plato, Ph&aelig;drus, p. 279 A.</p>

    <p>
      When we consider that the Ph&aelig;drus was pretty sure to bring
      upon Plato a good deal of enmity &#8212; since it attacked, by name,
      both Lysias, a resident at Athens of great influence and ability,
      and several other contemporary rhetors more or less celebrated &#8212;
      we can understand how Plato became disposed to lighten this amount
      of enmity by a compliment paid to Isokrates. This latter rhetor, a
      few years older than Plato, was the son of opulent parents at
      Athens, and received a good education; but when his family became
      impoverished by the disasters at the close of the Peloponnesian
      war, he established himself as a teacher of rhetoric at Chios:
      after some time, however, he returned to Athens, and followed the
      same profession there. He engaged himself also, like Lysias, in
      composing discourses for pleaders before the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page36" id="v3page36"></a>36</span>dikastery<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_88" href="#Footnotev3_26_88"><span
          class="sp">88</span></a> and for speakers in the assembly; by
      which practice he acquired both fortune and reputation. Later in
      life, he relinquished these harangues destined for real persons on
      real occasions, and confined himself to the composition of
      discourses (intended, not for contentious debate, but for the
      pleasure and instruction of hearers) on general questions &#8212;
      social, political, and philosophical: at the same time receiving
      numerous pupils from different cities of Greece. Through such
      change, he came into a sort of middle position between the
      rhetoric of Lysias and the dialectic of Plato: insomuch that the
      latter, at the time when he composed the Ph&aelig;drus, had
      satisfaction in contrasting him favourably with Lysias, and in
      prophesying that he would make yet greater progress towards
      philosophy. But at the time when Plato composed the
      Euthyd&ecirc;mus, his feeling was different.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_89" href="#Footnotev3_26_89"><span
          class="sp">89</span></a> In the Ph&aelig;drus, Isokrates is
      compared with Lysias and other rhetors, and in that comparison
      Plato presents him as greatly superior: in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus,
      he is compared with philosophers as well as with rhetors, and is
      even announced as disparaging philosophy generally: Plato then
      declares him to be a presumptuous half-bred, and extols against
      him even the very philosopher whom he himself had just been
      caricaturing. To apply a Platonic simile, the most beautiful ape
      is ugly compared with man &#8212; the most beautiful man is an ape
      compared with the Gods:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_90"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a> the same
      intermediate position between rhetoric and philosophy is assigned
      by Plato to Isokrates.</p>

        Plutarch, Vit. x. Oratt. pp. 837-838.</p>
      <p>
        The Athenian Polykrates had been forced, by loss of property, to
        quit Athens and undertake the work of a Sophist in Cyprus.
        Isokrates expresses much sympathy for him: it was a misfortune
        like what had happened to himself (Orat. xi. Busiris 1). Compare
        De Permutation. Or. xv. s. 172.</p>
      <p>
        The assertion made by Isokrates &#8212; that he did not compose
        political and judicial orations, to be spoken by individuals for
        real causes and public discussions &#8212; may be true comparatively,
        and with reference to a certain period of his life. But it is
        only to be received subject to much reserve and qualification.
        Even out of the twenty-one orations of Isokrates which we
        possess, the last five are composed to be spoken by pleaders
        before the dikastery. They are such discourses as the
        logographers, Lysias among the rest, were called upon to
        furnish, and paid for furnishing.</p>

        Plato, Hipp. Major, p. 289.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      From the pen of Isokrates also, we find various passages
      apparently directed against the viri Socratici including Plato <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page37" id="v3page37"></a>37</span>(though
      without his name): depreciating,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_91"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a> as idle
      and worthless, new political theories, analytical discussions on
      the principles of ethics, and dialectic subtleties; maintaining
      that the word philosophy was erroneously interpreted and defined
      by many contemporaries, in a sense too much withdrawn from
      practical results: and affirming that his own teaching was
      calculated to impart genuine philosophy. During the last half of
      Plato&#8217;s life, his school and that of Isokrates were the most
      celebrated among all that existed at Athens. There was competition
      between them, gradually kindling into rivalry. Such rivalry became
      vehement during the last ten years of Plato&#8217;s life, when his
      scholar Aristotle, then an aspiring young man of twenty-five,
      proclaimed a very contemptuous opinion of Isokrates, and commenced
      a new school of rhetoric in opposition to him.<a

          class="sp">92</span></a> Kephisod&ocirc;rus, a pupil of
      Isokrates, retaliated; publishing against Aristotle, as well as
      against Plato, an acrimonious work which was still read some
      centuries afterwards. Theopompus, another eminent pupil of
      Isokrates, commented unfavourably upon Plato in his writings: and
      other writers who did the same may probably have belonged to the
      Isokratean school.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_93"

      <p>
        Schroeder&#8217;s Qu&aelig;stiones Isocrate&aelig; (Utrecht, 1859),
        and Spengel&#8217;s work, Isokrates und Plato, are instructive in
        regard to these two contemporary luminaries of the intellectual
        world at Athens. But, unfortunately, we can make out few
        ascertainable facts. When I read the Oration De Permut., Or. xv.
        (composed by Isokrates about fifteen years before his own death,
        and about five years before the death of Plato, near 353 <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span>), I am impressed with the belief
        that many of his complaints about unfriendly and bitter
        criticism refer to the Platonic School of that day, Aristotle
        being one of its members. See sections 48-90-276, and seq. He
        certainly means the Sokratic men, and Plato as the most
        celebrated of them, when he talks of &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054;

        &#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#8212; those who are powerful in contentious dialectic,
        and at the same time cultivate geometry and astronomy, which
        others call &#7936;&#948;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#967;&#943;&#945; and &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945; (280) &#8212; those who exhorted
        hearers to virtue about which others knew nothing, and about
        which they themselves were in dispute. When he complains of the
        &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#953; of the ancient Sophists, Empedokles, Ion,
        Parmenides, Melissus, &amp;c., we cannot but suppose that he had
        in his mind the Tim&aelig;us of Plato also, though he avoids
        mention of the name.</p>

    <p>
      I have already observed that I dissent from the hypothesis of
      Schleiermacher, Ast, and others, who regard the Ph&aelig;drus
      either as positively the earliest, or at least among the earliest,
      of the Platonic dialogues, composed several years before the death
      of Sokrates. I agree with Hermann, Stallbaum, and those other
      critics, who refer it to a much later period of Plato&#8217;s life:
      though I see no sufficient evidence to determine more exactly
      either its date or its place in the chronological series of
      dialogues. The views opened in the second half of the dialogue, on
      the theory of rhetoric and on the efficacy of written compositions
      as a means of instruction, are very interesting and remarkable.</p>

        three discourses &#8212; His theory of Rhetoric is more Platonic than

    <p>
      The written discourse of Lysias (presented to us as one greatly
      admired at the time by his friends, Ph&aelig;drus among them) is
      contrasted first with a pleading on the same subject (though not
      directed towards the attainment of the same end) by Sokrates
      (supposed to be improvised<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page39"
          id="v3page39"></a>39</span> on the occasion); next with a
      second pleading of Sokrates directly opposed to the former, and
      intended as a recantation. These three discourses are criticised
      from the rhetorical point of view,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_97"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> and are
      made the handle for introducing to us a theory of rhetoric. The
      second discourse of Sokrates, far from being Sokratic in tenor, is
      the most exuberant effusion of mingled philosophy, poetry, and
      mystic theology, that ever emanated from Plato.</p>

      The theory of rhetoric too is far more Platonic than Sokratic. The
      peculiar vein of Sokrates is that of confessed ignorance, ardour
      in enquiry, and testing cross-examination of all who answer his
      questions. But in the Ph&aelig;drus we find Plato (under the name
      of Sokrates) assuming, as the basis of his theory, that an
      expositor shall be found who <i>knows</i> what is really and
      truly just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and dishonourable
      &#8212; distinct from, and independent of, the established beliefs on

      of classifying and declassifying: in which it is assumed that the
      expositor will find minds unoccupied and unprejudiced, ready to
      welcome the truth when he lays it before them. But there are many
      topics on which men&#8217;s minds are, in the common and natural course
      of things, both pre-occupied and dissentient with each other. This
      is especially the case with Justice, Goodness, the Honourable,
      &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_101" href="#Footnotev3_26_101"><span
          class="sp">101</span></a> It is one of the first requisites
      for the expositor to be able to discriminate this class of topics,
      where error and discordance grow up naturally among those whom he
      addresses. It is here that men are liable to be deceived, and
      require to be undeceived &#8212; contradict each other, and argue on
      opposite sides: such disputes belong to the province of Rhetoric.</p>

    <p>
      The Rhetor is one who does not teach (according to the logical
      process previously described), but persuades; guiding the mind by
      discourse to or from various opinions or sentiments.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_102" href="#Footnotev3_26_102"><span
          class="sp">102</span></a> Now if this is to be done <i>by art</i>
      and methodically &#8212; that is, upon principle or system explicable
      and defensible &#8212; it pre-supposes (according to Plato) a knowledge
      of truth, and can only be performed by the logical expositor. For
      when men are deceived, it is only because they mistake what is
      like truth for truth itself: when they are undeceived, it is
      because they are made to perceive that what they believe to be
      truth is only an apparent likeness thereof. Such resemblances are
      strong or faint, differing by many gradations. Now no one can
      detect, or bring into account, or compare, these shades of
      resemblance, except he who knows the truth to which they all
      ultimately refer. It is through the slight differences that
      deception is operated. To deceive a man, you must carry him
      gradually away from the truth by transitional stages, each
      resembling that which immediately precedes, though the last in the
      series will hardly at all resemble the first: to undeceive him (or
      to avoid being deceived yourself), you must conduct him back by
      the counter-process from error to truth, by a series of
      transitional resemblances tending in that direction. You cannot do
      this like an artist (on system and by pre-determination), unless
      you know <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page41" id="v3page41"></a>41</span>what

        discourse. He must know how to fit on the one to the other in
        each particular case.</span></p>
    <p>
      The Rhetor &#8212; being assumed as already knowing the truth &#8212; if he
      wishes to make persuasion an art, must proceed in the following
      manner:&#8212; He must distribute the multiplicity of individual minds
      into distinct classes, each marked by its characteristic features
      of differences, emotional and intellectual. He must also
      distribute the manifold modes of discourse into distinct classes,
      each marked in like manner. Each of these modes of discourse is
      well adapted to persuade some classes of mind &#8212; badly adapted to
      persuade other classes: for such adaptation or non-adaptation
      there exists a rational necessity,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_104"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a> which
      the Rhetor must examine and ascertain, informing himself which
      modes of discourse are adapted to each different class of mind.
      Having mastered this general question, he must, whenever he is
      about to speak, be able to distinguish, by rapid perception,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_105" href="#Footnotev3_26_105"><span
          class="sp">105</span></a> to which class of minds the hearer
      or hearers whom he is addressing belong: and accordingly, which
      mode of discourse is adapted to their particular case. Moreover,
      he must also seize, in the case before him, the seasonable moment
      and the appropriate limit, for the use of each mode of discourse.
      Unless the Rhetor is capable of fulfilling all these exigencies,
      without failing in any one point, his Rhetoric is not entitled to
      be called an Art. He requires, in order to be an artist in
      persuading the mind, as great an assemblage of varied capacities
      as Hippokrates declares to be necessary for a physician, the
      artist for curing or preserving the body.<a

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_48"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_48"></a> Plato&#8217;s <i>Id&eacute;al</i> of the
        Rhetorical Art &#8212; involves in part incompatible conditions &#8212; the
        Wise man or philosopher will never be listened to by the public.</span></p>
    <p>
      The total, thus summed up by Plato, of what is necessary to
      constitute an Art of Rhetoric, is striking and comprehensive. It
      is indeed an <i>id&eacute;al</i>, not merely unattainable by
      reason of its magnitude, but also including <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page42" id="v3page42"></a>42</span>impracticable
      conditions. He begins by postulating a perfectly wise man, who
      knows all truth on the most important social subjects; on which
      his country-men hold erroneous beliefs, just as sincerely as <i>he</i>
      holds his true beliefs. But Plato has already told us, in the
      Gorgias, that such a person will not be listened to: that in order
      to address auditors with effect, the rhetor must be in genuine
      harmony of belief and character with them, not dissenting from
      them either for the better or the worse: nay, that the true
      philosopher (so we read in one of the most impressive portions of
      the Republic) not only has no chance of guiding the public mind,
      but incurs public obloquy, and may think himself fortunate if he
      escapes persecution.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_107"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> The
      dissenter will never be allowed to be the guide of a body of
      orthodox believers; and is even likely enough, unless he be
      prudent, to become their victim. He may be permitted to lecture or
      discuss, in the gardens of the Academy, with a few chosen friends,
      and to write eloquent dialogues: but if he embodies his views in
      motions before the public assembly, he will find only strenuous
      opposition, or something worse. This view, which is powerfully set
      forth by Sokrates both in the Gorgias and Republic, is founded on
      a just appreciation of human societies: and it is moreover the
      basis of the Sokratic procedure &#8212; That the first step to be taken
      is to disabuse men&#8217;s minds of their false persuasion of knowledge
      &#8212; to make them conscious of ignorance &#8212; and thus to open their
      minds for the reception of truth. But if this be the fact, we must
      set aside as impracticable the postulate advanced by Sokrates here
      in the Ph&aelig;drus &#8212; of a perfectly wise man as the employer of
      rhetorical artifices. Moreover I do not agree with what Sokrates
      is here made to lay down as the philosophy of Error:&#8212; that it
      derives its power of misleading from resemblance to truth. This is
      the case to a certain extent: but it is very incomplete as an
      account of the generating causes of error.</p>

        is grand but unattainable &#8212; breadth of psychological data and

    <p>
      But the other portion of Plato&#8217;s sum total of what is necessary to
      an Art of Rhetoric, is not open to the same objection. It involves
      no incompatible conditions: and we can say nothing against it,
      except that it requires <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page43"
          id="v3page43"></a>43</span>a breadth and logical command of
      scientific data, far greater than there is the smallest chance of
      attaining. That Art is an assemblage of processes, directed to a
      definite end, and prescribed by rules which themselves rest upon
      scientific data &#8212; we find first announced in the works of Plato.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_108" href="#Footnotev3_26_108"><span
          class="sp">108</span></a> A vast amount of scientific
      research, both inductive and deductive, is here assumed as an
      indispensable foundation &#8212; and even as a portion &#8212; of what he
      calls the Art of Rhetoric: first, a science of psychology,
      complete both in its principles and details: next, an exhaustive
      catalogue and classification of the various modes of operative
      speech, with their respective impression upon each different class
      of minds. So prodigious a measure of scientific requirement has
      never yet been filled up: of course, therefore, no one has ever
      put together a body of precepts commensurate with it. Aristotle,
      following partially the large conceptions of his master, has given
      a comprehensive view of many among the theoretical postulates of
      Rhetoric; and has partially enumerated the varieties both of
      persuadable auditors, and of persuasive means available to the
      speaker for guiding them. Cicero, Dionysius of Halikarnassus,
      Quintilian, have furnished valuable contributions towards this
      last category of data, but not much towards the first: being all
      of them defective in breadth of psychological theory. Nor has <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page44" id="v3page44"></a>44</span>Plato
      himself done anything to work out his conception in detail or to
      provide suitable rules for it. We read it only as an impressive
      sketch &#8212; a grand but unattainable <i>id&eacute;al</i> &#8212; &#8220;qualem
      nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum&#8221;.</p>

      <p>
        The relation of Art to Science is thus perspicuously stated by
        Mr. John Stuart Mill, in the concluding chapter of his System of
        Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive (Book vi. ch. xii. &sect; 2): </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The relation in which rules of Art stand to doctrines of
        Science may be thus characterised. The Art proposes to itself an
        end to be attained, defines the end, and hands it over to the
        Science. The Science receives it, considers it as a phenomenon
        or effect to be studied, and having investigated its causes and
        conditions, sends it back to Art with a theorem of the
        combinations of circumstances by which it could be produced. Art
        then examines these combinations of circumstances, and according
        as any of them are or are not in human power, pronounces the end
        attainable or not. The only one of the premisses, therefore,
        which Art supplies, is the original major premiss, which asserts
        that the attainment of the given end is desirable. Science then
        lends to Art the proposition (obtained by a series of inductions
        or of deductions) that the performance of certain actions will
        attain the end. From these premisses Art concludes that the
        performance of these actions is desirable; and finding it also
        practicable, converts the theorem into a rule or precept.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Indeed it seems that Plato himself regarded it as unattainable &#8212;
      and as only worth aiming at for the purpose of pleasing the Gods,
      not with any view to practical benefit, arising from either speech
      or action among mankind.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_109"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a> This
      is a point to be considered, when we compare his views on Rhetoric
      with those of Lysias and the other rhetors, whom he here judges
      unfavourably and even contemptuously. The work of speech and
      action among mankind, which Plato sets aside as unworthy of
      attention, was the express object of solicitude to Lysias,
      Isokrates, and rhetors generally: that which they practised
      efficaciously themselves, and which they desired to assist,
      cultivate, and improve in others: that which Perikles, in his
      funeral oration preserved by Thucydides, represents as the pride
      of the Athenian people collectively<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_110"

      combination of full freedom of preliminary contentious debate,
      with energy in executing the resolution which might be ultimately
      adopted. These rhetors, by the example of their composed speeches
      as well as by their teaching, did much to impart to young men the
      power of expressing themselves with fluency and effect before
      auditors, either in the assembly or in the dikastery: as Sokrates
      here fully admits.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_111"

      Towards this purpose it was useful to analyse the constituent
      parts of a discourse, and to give an appropriate name to each
      part. Accordingly, all the rhetorical teachers (Quintilian
      included) continued such analysis, though differing more or less
      in their way of performing it, until the extinction of Pagan
      civilisation. Young men were taught to learn by heart regular
      discourses,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_112" href="#Footnotev3_26_112"><span
          class="sp">112</span></a> &#8212; to compose the like for themselves
      &#8212; to understand the difference between such as were well or ill
      composed &#8212; and to acquire a command of oratorical means for moving
      or convincing the hearer. All this instruction had a practical
      value: <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page45" id="v3page45"></a>45</span>though
      Plato, both here and elsewhere, treats it as worthless. A citizen
      who stood mute and embarrassed, unable to argue a case with some
      propriety before an audience, felt himself helpless and defective
      in one of the characteristic privileges of a Greek and a freeman:
      while one who could perform the process well, acquired much esteem
      and influence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_113"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a> The
      Platonic Sokrates in the Gorgias consoles the speechless men by
      saying &#8212; What does this signify, provided you are just and
      virtuous? Such consolation failed to satisfy: as it would fail to
      satisfy the sick, the lame, or the blind.</p>

        I have illustrated this point in my History of Greece, by the
        example of Xenophon in his command of the Cyreian army during
        its retreat.</p>
      <p>
        His democratical education, and his powers of public speaking,
        were of the greatest service not only in procuring influence to
        himself, but also in conducting the army through its many perils
        and difficulties.</p>
      <p>
        See Aristot. Rhet. i. 1, 3, p. 1355, b. 1.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_51"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_51"></a> The Rhetorical teachers conceived
        the Art too narrowly: Plato conceived it too widely. The
        principles of an Art are not required to be explained to all
        learners.</span></p>
    <p>
      The teaching of these rhetors thus contributed to the security,
      dignity, and usefulness of the citizens, by arming them for public
      speech and action. But it was essentially practical, or empirical:
      it had little system, and was founded upon a narrow theory. Upon
      these points Plato in the Ph&aelig;drus attacks them. He sets
      little value upon the accomplishments arming men for speech and
      action (&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;) &#8212; and he will not allow
      such teaching to be called an Art. He explains, in opposition to
      them, what he himself conceived the Art of Rhetoric to be, in the
      comprehensive way which I have above described.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      But if the conception of the Art, as entertained by the Rhetors,
      is too narrow &#8212; that of Plato, on the other hand, is too wide.</p>
    <p>
      First, it includes the whole basis of science or theory on which
      the Art rests: it is a Philosophy of Rhetoric, expounded by a
      theorist &#8212; rather than an Art of Rhetoric, taught to learners by a
      master. To teach the observance of certain rules or precepts is
      one thing: to set forth the reasons upon which those rules are
      founded, is another &#8212; highly important indeed, and proper to be
      known by the teacher; yet not necessarily communicated, or even
      communicable, to all learners. Quintilian, in his Institutio
      Rhetorica, gives both:&#8212; an ample theory, as well as an ample <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page46" id="v3page46"></a>46</span>development
      of rules, of his professional teaching. But he would not have
      thought himself obliged to give this ample theory to all learners.
      With many, he would have been satisfied to make them understand
      the rules, and to exercise them in the ready observance thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_52"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_52"></a> Plato includes in his conception of
        Art, the application thereof to new particular cases. &#8212; This can
        never be taught by rule.</span></p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Plato, in defining the Art of Rhetoric, includes not
      only its foundation of science (which, though intimately connected
      with it, ought not to be considered as a constituent part), but
      also the application of it to particular cases; which application
      lies beyond the province both of science and of art, and cannot be
      reduced to any rule. &#8220;The Rhetor&#8221; (says Plato) &#8220;must teach his
      pupils, not merely to observe the rules whereby persuasion is
      operated, but also to know the particular persons to whom those
      rules are to be applied &#8212; on what occasions &#8212; within what limits &#8212;
      at what peculiar moments, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_114"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a> Unless
      the Rhetor can teach thus much, his pretended art is no art at
      all: all his other teaching is of no value.&#8221; Now this is an amount
      of exigence which can never be realised. Neither art nor science
      can communicate that which Plato here requires. The rules of art,
      together with many different hypothetical applications thereof,
      may be learnt: when the scientific explanation of the rules is
      superadded, the learner will be assisted farther towards fresh
      applications: but after both these have been learnt, the new cases
      which will arise can never be specially foreseen. The proper way
      of applying the general precepts to each case must be suggested by
      conjecture adapted to the circumstances, under the corrections of
      past experience.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_115"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_115"><span class="sp">115</span></a> It is
      inconsistent in Plato, after affirming that nothing <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page47" id="v3page47"></a>47</span>deserves
      the name of art<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_116"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> except
      what is general &#8212; capable of being rationally anticipated and
      prescribed beforehand &#8212; then to include in art the special
      treatment required for the multiplicity of particular cases; the
      analogy of the medical art, which he here instructively invokes,
      would be against him on this point.</p>

        What Longinus says about critical skill is applicable here also
        &#8212; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945;. Isokrates (De
        Permut. Or. xv. sect. 290-312-316) has some good remarks about
        the impossibility of &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; respecting particulars. Plato, in
        the Gorgias, puts &#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;, which he states to depend upon reason
        and foreknowledge, in opposition to &#7952;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#943;&#945; and &#964;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#942;, which he
        considers as dependant on the &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#963;&#964;&#959;&#967;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;. But in applying
        the knowledge or skill called Art to particular cases, the &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;
        &#963;&#964;&#959;&#967;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#x1F74; is the best that can be had (p. 463 A-B). The
        conception of &#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951; given in the Gorgias is open to the same
        remark as that which we find in the Ph&aelig;drus. Plato, in
        another passage of the Ph&aelig;drus, speaks of the necessity
        that &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, and &#956;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#964;&#951;, shall concur to make an
        accomplished orator. This is very true; and Lysias, Isokrates,
        and all the other rhetors whom Plato satirises, would have
        concurred in it. In his description of &#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951; and &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, and
        in the estimate which he gives of all that it comprises, he
        leaves no outlying ground for &#956;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#964;&#951;. Compare Xenophon, Memor.
        iii. 1, 11; also Isokrates contra Sophistas, a. 16; and a good
        passage of Dionysius Halik. De Compos. Verborum, in which that
        rhetor remarks that &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#962; or opportunity neither has been nor
        can be reduced to art and rule.</p>

        Rhetorical teachers is not made out.</span></p>
    <p>
      While therefore Plato&#8217;s view of the science or theory of Rhetoric
      is far more comprehensive and philosophical than any thing given
      by the rhetorical teachers &#8212; he has not made good his charge
      against them, that what they taught as an art of Rhetoric was
      useless and illusory. The charge can only be sustained if we grant
      &#8212; what appears to have been Plato&#8217;s own feeling &#8212; that the social
      and political life of the Athenians was a dirty and corrupt
      business, unworthy of a virtuous man to meddle with. This is the
      argument of Sokrates (in the Gorgias,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_117"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a> the
      other great anti-rhetorical dialogue), proclaiming himself to
      stand alone and aloof, an isolated, free-thinking dissenter. As
      representing his sincere conviction, and interpreting Plato&#8217;s plan
      of life, this argument deserves honourable recognition. But we
      must remember that Lysias and the rhetorical teachers repudiated
      such a point of view. They aimed at assisting and strengthening
      others to perform their parts, not in speculative debate on
      philosophy, but in active citizenship; and they succeeded in this
      object to a great degree. The rhetorical ability of Lysias
      personally is attested not merely by the superlative encomium on
      him assigned to Ph&aelig;drus,<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_118"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a> but
      also by his great celebrity &#8212; by the frequent demand for his
      services as a logographer or composer of discourses for others &#8212;
      by the number of his discourses preserved and studied after his
      death. He, and a fair proportion of the other rhetors named in the
      Ph&aelig;drus, performed well the useful work which they
      undertook.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_54"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_54"></a> Plato has not treated Lysias
        fairly, in neglecting his greater works, and selecting for
        criticism an erotic exercise for a private circle.</span></p>
    <p>
      When Plato selects, out of the very numerous discourses before him
      composed by Lysias, one hardly intended for any real auditors &#8212;
      neither deliberative, nor judicial, nor panegyrical, but an
      ingenious erotic paradox for a <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page48" id="v3page48"></a>48</span>private circle of
      friends &#8212; this is no fair specimen of the author. Moreover Plato
      criticises it as if it were a philosophic exposition instead of an
      oratorical pleading. He complains that Lysias does not begin his
      discourse by defining &#8212; but neither do Demosthenes and other great
      orators proceed in that manner. He affirms that there is no
      organic structure, or necessary sequence, in the discourse, and
      that the sentences of it might be read in an inverted order:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_26_119" href="#Footnotev3_26_119"><span
          class="sp">119</span></a> &#8212; and this remark is to a certain
      extent well-founded. In respect to the skilful marshalling of the
      different parts of a discourse, so as to give best effect to the
      whole, Dionysius of Halikarnassus<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_120"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a>
      declares Lysias to be inferior to some other orators &#8212; while
      ascribing to him marked oratorical superiority on various other
      points. Yet Plato, in specifying his objections against the erotic
      discourses of Lysias, does not show that it offends against the
      sound general principle which he himself lays down respecting the
      art of persuasion &#8212; That the topics insisted on by the persuader
      shall be adapted to the feelings and dispositions of the
      persuadend. Far from violating this principle, Lysias kept it in
      view, and employed it to the best of his power &#8212; as we may see,
      not merely by his remaining orations, but also by the testimonies
      of the critics:<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_121"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a> though
      he did not go through the large preliminary work of scientific
      classification, both of different minds and different persuasive
      apparatus, which Plato considers essential to a thorough
      comprehension and mastery of the principle. </p>

        special excellence of Lysias (according to this critic) lay in
        his judicial orations, which were highly persuasive and
        plausible: the manner of presenting thoughts was ingenious and
        adapted to the auditors: the narration of facts and details,
        especially, was performed with unrivalled skill. But as to the
        marshalling of the different parts of a discourse, Dionysius
        considers Lysias as inferior to some other orators &#8212; and still
        more inferior in respect to &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#8052;&#962; and to strong emotional

        Dionys. Hal. (Ars Rhetorica, p. 381) notices the severe
        exigencies which Plato here imposes upon the Rhetor, remarking
        that scarcely any rhetorical discourse could be produced which
        came up to them. The defect did not belong to Lysias alone, but
        to all other rhetors also &#8212; &#8001;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949; &#947;&#8048;&#961; <span class="gesp">&#954;&#945;&#8054;

        between this exercise of Lysias and the discourses delivered by
        Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;drus.</span></p>
    <p>
      The first discourse assigned by Plato to Sokrates professes to be
      placed in competition with the discourse of Lysias, and to aim at
      the same object. But in reality it aims <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page49" id="v3page49"></a>49</span>at a different
      object: it gives the dissuasive arguments, but omits the
      persuasive &#8212; as Ph&aelig;drus is made to point out: so that it
      cannot be fairly compared with the discourse of Lysias. Still more
      may this be said respecting the second discourse of Sokrates:
      which is of a character and purpose so totally disparate, that no
      fair comparison can be taken between it and the ostensible
      competitor. The mixture of philosophy, mysticism, and dithyrambic
      poetry, which the second discourse of Sokrates presents, was
      considered by a rhetorical judge like Dionysius as altogether
      inconsistent with the scope and purpose of reasonable discourse.<a

          class="sp">122</span></a> In the Menexenus, Plato has brought

      Plato has there entirely neglected the exigencies enforced in the
      Ph&aelig;drus, and has composed a funeral discourse upon the
      received type; which Lysias and other orators before him had
      followed, from Perikles downward. But in the Ph&aelig;drus, Plato
      criticises Lysias upon principles which are a medley between
      philosophy and rhetoric. Lysias, in defending himself, might have
      taken the same ground as we find Sokrates himself taking in the
      Euthyd&ecirc;mus. &#8220;Philosophy and politics are two distinct walks,
      requiring different aptitudes, and having each its own
      practitioners. A man may take whichever he pleases; but he must
      not arrogate to himself superiority by an untoward attempt to join
      the two together.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_124"

    <p>
      Another important subject is also treated in the Ph&aelig;drus.
      Sokrates delivers views both original and characteristic,
      respecting the efficacy of continuous discourse &#8212; either written
      to be read, or spoken to be heard without cross-examination &#8212; as a
      means of instruction. They are re-stated &#8212; in a manner
      substantially the same, though with some variety and fulness of
      illustration &#8212; in Plato&#8217;s seventh Epistle<a

      have already touched upon these views in my <span

      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_8_51">Chapter</a>, on the
      Platonic Dialogues generally, and have <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page50" id="v3page50"></a>50</span>pointed out how
      much Plato understood to be involved in what he termed <i>knowledge</i>.
      No man (in his view) could be said to know, who was not competent
      to sustain successfully, and to apply successfully, a Sokratic
      cross-examination. Now knowledge, involving such a competency,
      certainly cannot be communicated by any writing, or by any fixed
      and unchangeable array of words, whether written or spoken. You
      must familiarise learners with the subject on many different
      sides, and in relation to many different points of view, each
      presenting more or less chance of error or confusion. Moreover,
      you must apply a different treatment to each mind, and to the same
      mind at different stages: no two are exactly alike, and the
      treatment adapted for one will be unsuitable for the other. While
      it is impossible, for these reasons, to employ any set forms of
      words, it will be found that the process of reading or listening
      leaves the reader or listener comparatively passive: there is
      nothing to stir the depths of the mind, or to evolve the inherent
      forces and dormant capacities. Dialectic conversation is the only
      process which can adapt itself with infinite variety to each
      particular case and moment &#8212; and which stimulates fresh mental
      efforts ever renewed on the part of each respondent and each
      questioner. Knowledge &#8212; being a slow result generated by this
      stimulating operation, when skilfully conducted, long continued,
      and much diversified &#8212; is not infused into, but evolved out of,
      the mind. It consists in a revival of those unchangeable Ideas or
      Forms, with which the mind during its state of eternal
      pre-existence had had communion. There are only a few privileged
      minds, however, that have had sufficient communion therewith to
      render such revival possible: accordingly, none but these few can
      ever rise to knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_126"

        Schleiermacher, in his Introduction to the Ph&aelig;drus, justly
        characterises this doctrine as genuine Sokratism &#8212; &#8220;die

        memorandum for persons who know &#8212; or as an elegant pastime.</span></p>
    <p>
      Though knowledge cannot be first communicated by written matters,
      yet if it has been once communicated and subsequently forgotten,
      it may be revived by written matters. Writing has thus a real,
      though secondary, usefulness, as a memorandum. And Plato doubtless
      accounted written dialogues the most useful of all <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page51" id="v3page51"></a>51</span>written
      compositions, because they imitated portions of that long oral
      process whereby alone knowledge had been originally generated. His
      dialogues were reports of the conversations purporting to have
      been held by Sokrates with others.</p>

        pitched too high to be realised.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is an excellent feature in the didactic theories of Plato, that
      they distinguish so pointedly between the passive and active
      conditions of the intellect; and that they postulate as
      indispensable, an habitual and cultivated mental activity, worked
      up by slow, long-continued, colloquy. To read or hear, and then to
      commit to memory, are in his view elegant recreations, but nothing
      more. But while, on this point, Plato&#8217;s didactic theories deserve
      admiration, we must remark on the other hand that they are pitched
      so high as to exceed human force, and to overpass all possibility
      of being realised.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_127"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a> They
      mark out an <i>id&eacute;al</i>, which no person ever attained,
      either then or since &#8212; like the Platonic theory of rhetoric. To be
      master of any subject, in the extent and perfection required for
      sustaining and administering a Sokratic cross-examination &#8212; is a
      condition which scarce any one can ever fulfil: certainly no one,
      except upon a small range of subjects. Assuredly, Plato himself
      never fulfilled it.</p>

        competent to solve the difficulties raised by Sokrates,
        Arkesilaus, Karneades, and the negative vein of philosophy.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such a cross-examination involved the mastery of all the openings
      for doubt, difficulty, deception, or refutation, bearing on the
      subject: openings which a man is to profit by, if assailant &#8212; to
      keep guarded, if defendant. Now when we survey the Greek negative
      philosophy, as it appears in Plato, Aristotle, and Sextus
      Empiricus &#8212; and when we recollect that between the second and the
      third of these names, there appeared three other philosophers
      equally or more formidable in the same vein, all whose arguments
      have perished (Arkesilaus, Karneades, &AElig;nesid&ecirc;mus) &#8212; we
      shall see that no man has ever been known competent both to strike
      and parry with these weapons, in a manner so skilful and ready as
      to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page52" id="v3page52"></a>52</span>amount
      to knowledge in the Platonic sense. But in so far as such
      knowledge is attainable or approachable, Plato is right in saying
      that it cannot be attained except by long dialectic practice.
      Reading books, and hearing lectures, are undoubtedly valuable
      aids, but insufficient by themselves. Modern times recede from it
      even more than ancient. Regulated oral dialectic has become
      unknown; the logical and metaphysical difficulties &#8212; which
      negative philosophy required to be solved before it would allow
      any farther progress &#8212; are now little heeded, amidst the
      multiplicity of observed facts, and theories adapted to and
      commensurate with those facts. This change in the character of
      philosophy is doubtless a great improvement. It is found that by
      acquiescing provisionally in the <i>axiomata media</i>, and by
      applying at every step the control of verification, now rendered
      possible by the multitude of ascertained facts &#8212; the sciences may
      march safely onward: notwithstanding that the logical and
      metaphysical difficulties, the puzzles (&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;) involved in <i>philosophia
        prima</i> and its very high abstractions, are left behind
      unsolved and indeterminate. But though the modern course of
      philosophy is preferable to the ancient, it is not for that reason
      to be considered as satisfactory. These metaphysical difficulties
      are not diminished either in force or relevancy, because modern
      writers choose to leave them unnoticed. Plato and Aristotle were
      quite right in propounding them as problems, the solution of which
      was indispensable to the exigencies and consistent schematism of
      the theorising intelligence, as well as to any complete
      discrimination between sufficient and insufficient evidence. Such
      they still remain, overlooked yet not defunct.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_26_60"
          id="Sidenotev3_26_60"></a> Plato&#8217;s <i>id&eacute;al</i>
        philosopher can only be realised under the hypothesis of a
        pre-existent and omniscient soul, stimulated into full
        reminiscence here.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now all these questions would be solved by the <i>id&eacute;al</i>
      philosopher whom Plato in the Ph&aelig;drus conceives as
      possessing knowledge: a person who shall be at once a negative
      Sokrates in excogitating and enforcing all the difficulties &#8212; and
      an affirmative match for Sokrates, as respondent in solving them:
      a person competent to apply this process to all the indefinite
      variety of individual minds, under the inspirations of the moment.
      This is a magnificent <i>id&eacute;al</i>. Plato affirms truly,
      that those teachers who taught rhetoric and philosophy by writing,
      could never produce such a pupil: <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page53" id="v3page53"></a>53</span>and that even the
      Sokratic dialectic training, though indispensable and far more
      efficacious, would fail in doing so, unless in those few cases
      where it was favoured by very superior capacity &#8212; understood by
      him as superhuman, and as a remnant from the pre-existing commerce
      of the soul with the world of Forms or Ideas. The foundation
      therefore of the whole scheme rests upon Plato&#8217;s hypothesis of an
      antecedent life of the soul, proclaimed by Sokrates here in his
      second or panegyrical discourse on Eros. The rhetorical teachers,
      with whom he here compares himself and whom he despises as aiming
      at low practical ends &#8212; might at any rate reply that they avoided
      losing themselves in such unmeasured and unwarranted hypotheses.</p>

        the Tim&aelig;us.</span></p>
    <p>
      One remark yet remains to be made upon the doctrine here set forth
      by Plato: that no teaching is possible by means of continuous
      discourse spoken or written &#8212; none, except through prolonged and
      varied oral dialectic.<a name="FnAnchorv3_26_128"
        href="#Footnotev3_26_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> To
      this doctrine Plato does not constantly conform in his practice:
      he departs from it on various important occasions. In the
      Tim&aelig;us, Sokrates calls upon the philosopher so named for an
      exposition on the deepest and most mysterious cosmical subjects.
      Tim&aelig;us delivers the exposition in a continuous harangue,
      without a word of remark or question addressed by any of the
      auditors: while at the beginning of the Kritias (the next
      succeeding dialogue) Sokrates greatly commends what Tim&aelig;us
      had spoken. The Kritias itself too (though unfinished) is given in
      the form of continuous exposition. Now, as the Tim&aelig;us is
      more abstruse than any other Platonic writing, we cannot imagine
      that Plato, at the time when he composed it, thought so meanly
      about continuous exposition, as a vehicle of instruction, as we
      find him declaring in the Ph&aelig;drus. I point this out, because
      it illustrates my opinion that the different dialogues of Plato
      represent very different, sometimes even opposite, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page54" id="v3page54"></a>54</span>points
      of view: and that it is a mistake to treat them as parts of one
      preconceived and methodical system.</p>

        The historical Sokrates would not allow his oral dialectic
        process to be called teaching. He expressly says &#8220;I have never
        been the teacher of any one&#8221; (Plat. Apol. Sokr. pp. 33 A, 19 E):
        and he disclaimed the possession of knowledge. Aristotle too
        considers teaching as a presentation of truths, ready made and
        supposed to be known, by the teacher to learners, who are bound
        to believe them, &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;. The Platonic
        Sokrates, in the Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion, differs from both;
        he recognises no teaching except the perpetual generation of new
        thoughts and feelings, by means of stimulating dialectic
        colloquy, and the revival in the mind thereby of the experience
        of an antecedent life, during which some communion has been
        enjoyed with the world of Ideas or Forms.</p>

        Plato&#8217;s mind &#8212; Extreme of the Transcendental or Absolute &#8212;
        Extreme of specialising adaptation to individuals and occasions.</span></p>
    <p>
      Plato is usually extolled by his admirers, as the champion of the
      Absolute &#8212; of unchangeable forms, immutable truth, objective
      necessity cogent and binding on every one. He is praised for
      having refuted Protagoras; who can find no standard beyond the
      individual recognition and belief, of his own mind or that of some
      one else. There is no doubt that Plato often talks in that strain:
      but the method followed in his dialogues, and the general
      principles of method which he lays down, here as well as
      elsewhere, point to a directly opposite conclusion. Of this the
      Ph&aelig;drus is a signal instance. Instead of the extreme of
      generality, it proclaims the extreme of specialty. The objection
      which the Sokrates of the Ph&aelig;drus advances against the
      didactic efficacy of written discourse, is founded on the fact,
      that it is the same to all readers &#8212; that it takes no cognizance
      of the differences of individual minds nor of the same mind at
      different times. Sokrates claims for dialectic debate the valuable
      privilege, that it is constant action and re-action between two
      individual minds &#8212; an appeal by the inherent force and actual
      condition of each, to the like elements in the other &#8212; an ever
      shifting presentation of the same topics, accommodated to the
      measure of intelligence and cast of emotion in the talkers and at
      the moment. The individuality of each mind &#8212; both questioner and
      respondent &#8212; is here kept in view as the governing condition of
      the process. No two minds can be approached by the same road or by
      the same interrogation. The questioner cannot advance a step
      except by the admission of the respondent. Every respondent is the
      measure to himself. He answers suitably to his own belief; he
      defends by his own suggestions; he yields to the pressure of
      contradiction and inconsistency, <i>when he feels them</i>, and
      not before. Each dialogist is (to use the Protagorean phrase) the
      measure to himself of truth and falsehood, according as he himself
      believes it. Assent or dissent, whichever it may be, springs only
      from the free working of the individual mind, in its actual
      condition then and there. It is to the individual mind alone, that
      appeal is made, and this is what Protagoras asks for.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page55" id="v3page55"></a>55</span>We
      thus find, in Plato&#8217;s philosophical character, two extreme
      opposite tendencies and opposite poles co-existent. We must
      recognise them both: but they can never be reconciled: sometimes
      he obeys and follows the one, sometimes the other.</p>
    <p>
      If it had been Plato&#8217;s purpose to proclaim and impose upon every
      one something which he called &#8220;Absolute Truth,&#8221; one and the same
      alike imperative upon all &#8212; he would best proclaim it by preaching
      or writing. To modify this &#8220;Absolute,&#8221; according to the varieties
      of the persons addressed, would divest it of its intrinsic
      attribute and excellence. If you pretend to deal with an Absolute,
      you must turn away your eyes from all diversity of apprehending
      intellects and believing subjects.</p>

        preceding &#8212; much transcendental assertion. Opposite character of
        the Parmenides.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the dialogues immediately preceding &#8212; Ph&aelig;don,
      Ph&aelig;drus, Symposion &#8212; we have seen Sokrates manifesting his
      usual dialectic, which never fails him: but we have also seen him
      indulging in a very unusual vein of positive affirmation and
      declaration. He has unfolded many novelties about the states of
      pre-existence and post-existence: he has familiarised us with
      Ideas, Forms, Essences, eternal and unchangeable, as the causes of
      all the facts and particularities of nature: he has recognised the
      inspired variety of madness, as being more worthy of trust than
      sober, uninspired, intelligence: he has recounted, with the faith
      of a communicant fresh from the mysteries, revelations made to him
      by the prophetess Diotima, &#8212; respecting the successive stages of
      exaltation whereby gifted intelligences, under the stimulus of
      Eros Philosophus, ascend into communion with the great sea of
      Beauty. All this is set forth with as much charm as Plato&#8217;s
      eloquence can bestow. But after all, it is not the true character
      of Sokrates:&#8212; I mean, the Sokrates of the Apology, whose mission
      it is to make war against the chronic malady of the human mind &#8212;
      false persuasion of knowledge, without the reality. It is, on the
      contrary, Sokrates himself infected with the same chronic malady
      which he combats in others, and requiring medicine against it as
      much as others. Such is the exact character in which Sokrates
      appears in the Parmenides: which dialogue I shall now proceed to
      review. </p>

        Parmenides the veteran censor and cross-examiner. Parmenides

    <p>
      The Parmenides announces its own purpose as intended to <span

      premature forwardness of affirmation, in a young philosophical
      aspirant: who, with meritorious eagerness in the search for truth,
      and with his eyes turned in the right direction to look for it &#8212;
      has nevertheless not fully estimated the obstructions besetting
      his path, nor exercised himself in the efforts necessary to
      overcome them. By a curious transposition, or perhaps from
      deference on Plato&#8217;s part to the Hellenic sentiment of Nemesis, &#8212;
      Sokrates, who in most Platonic dialogues stands forward as the
      privileged censor and victorious opponent, is here the juvenile
      defendant under censorship by a superior. It is the veteran
      Parmenides of Elea who, while commending the speculative impulse
      and promise of Sokrates, impresses upon him at the same time that
      the theory which he had advanced &#8212; the self-existence, the
      separate and substantive nature, of Ideas &#8212; stands exposed to many
      grave objections, which he (Sokrates) has not considered and
      cannot meet. So far, Parmenides performs towards Sokrates the same
      process of cross-examining refutation as Sokrates himself applies
      to The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and other young men elsewhere. But we
      find in this dialogue something ulterior and even peculiar. Having
      warned Sokrates that his intellectual training has not yet been
      carried to a point commensurate with the earnestness of his
      aspirations &#8212; Parmenides proceeds to describe to him what
      exercises he ought to go through, in order to guard himself
      against premature assertion or hasty partiality. Moreover,
      Parmenides not only indicates in general terms what ought to be
      done, but illustrates it by giving a specimen of such exercise, on
      a topic chosen by himself. </p>

      we find Sokrates, Parmenides, and the Eleatic Zeno (the disciple
      of Parmenides), engaged in the main dialogue. When Parmenides
      begins his illustrative exercise, a person named Aristotle
      (afterwards one of the Thirty oligarchs at Athens), still younger
      than Sokrates, is made to serve as respondent.</p>

        This dramatic introduction is extremely complicated. The whole
        dialogue, from beginning to end, is recounted by Kephalus of
        Klazomen&aelig;; who heard it from the Athenian Antiphon &#8212; who
        himself had heard it from Pythod&ocirc;rus, a friend of Zeno,
        present when the conversation was held. A string of
        circumstances are narrated by Kephalus, to explain how he came
        to wish to hear it, and to find out Antiphon. Plato appears
        anxious to throw the event back as far as possible into the
        past, in order to justify the bringing Sokrates into personal
        communication with Parmenides: for some unfriendly critics tried
        to make out that the two could not possibly have conversed on
        philosophy (Athen&aelig;us, xi. 505). Plato declares the ages of
        the persons with remarkable exactness: Parmenides was 65,
        completely grey-headed, but of noble mien: Zeno about 40, tall
        and graceful: Sokrates very young. (Plat. Parmen. p. 127 B-C.)</p>
      <p>
        It required some invention in Plato to provide a narrator,
        suitable for recounting events so long antecedent as the young
        period of Sokrates.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Sokrates is one among various auditors, who are assembled to hear
      Zeno reading aloud a treatise of his own composition, intended to
      answer and retort upon the opponents of his preceptor Parmenides.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_4"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_4"></a>Manner in which the doctrine of
        Parmenides was impugned. Manner in which his partisan Zeno
        defended him.</span></p>
    <p>
      The main doctrine of the real Parmenides was, &#8220;That Ens, the
      absolute, real, self-existent, was One and not many&#8221;: which
      doctrine was impugned and derided by various opponents, deducing
      from it absurd conclusions. Zeno defended his master by showing
      that the opposite doctrine ( &#8212; &#8220;That Ens, the absolute,
      self-existent universe, is Many &#8212; &#8221;) led to conclusions absurd in
      an equal or greater degree. If the Absolute were Many, the many
      would be both like and unlike: but they cannot have incompatible
      and contradictory attributes: therefore Absolute Ens is not Many.
      Ens, as Parmenides conceived it, was essentially homogeneous and
      unchangeable: even assuming it to be Many, all its parts must be
      homogeneous, so that what was predicable of one must be predicable
      of all; it might be all alike, or all unlike: but it could not be
      both. Those who maintained the plurality of Ens, did so on the
      ground of apparent severalty, likeness, and unlikeness, in the
      sensible world. But Zeno, while admitting these phenomena in the
      sensible world, as <i>relative to us</i>, apparent, and subject
      to the varieties of individual estimation &#8212; denied their
      applicability to absolute and self-existent Ens.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_2" href="#Footnotev3_27_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      Since absolute Ens or Entia are Many (said the opponents of
      Parmenides), they will be both like and unlike: and thus we can
      explain the phenomena of the sensible world. The absolute (replied
      Zeno) cannot be both like and unlike; therefore it cannot be many.
      We must recollect <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page59"
          id="v3page59"></a>59</span>that both Parmenides and Zeno
      renounced all attempt to explain the sensible world by the
      absolute and purely intelligible Ens. They treated the two as
      radically distinct and unconnected. The one was absolute, eternal,
      unchangeable, homogeneous, apprehended only by reason. The other
      was relative, temporary, variable, heterogeneous; a world of
      individual and subjective opinion, upon which no absolute truth,
      no pure objectivity, could be reached.</p>

        Zeno. He affirms the Platonic theory of ideas separate from
        sensible objects, yet participable by them.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates, depicted here as a young man, impugns this doctrine of
      Zeno: and maintains that the two worlds, though naturally
      disjoined, were not incommunicable. He advances the Platonic
      theory of Ideas: that is, an intelligible world of many separate
      self-existent Forms or Ideas, apprehended by reason only &#8212; and a
      sensible world of particular objects, each participating in one or
      more of these Forms or Ideas. &#8220;What you say (he remarks to Zeno),
      is true of the world of Forms or Ideas: the Form of Likeness <i>per
        se</i> can never be unlike, nor can the Form of Unlikeness be
      ever like. But in regard to the sensible world, there is nothing
      to hinder you and me, and other objects which rank and are
      numbered as separate individuals, from participating both in the
      Form of likeness and in the Form of unlikeness.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_3" href="#Footnotev3_27_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
      In so far as I, an individual object, participate in the Form of
      Likeness, I am properly called like; in so far as I participate in
      the Form of Unlikeness, I am called unlike. So about One and Many,
      Great and Little, and so forth: I, the same individual, may
      participate in many different and opposite Forms, and may derive
      from them different and opposite denominations. I am one and many
      &#8212; like and unlike &#8212; great and little &#8212; all at the same time. But
      no such combination is possible between the Forms themselves,
      self-existent and opposite: the Form of Likeness cannot become
      unlike, nor <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The Forms themselves stand
      permanently apart, incapable of fusion or coalescence with each
      other: but different and even opposite Forms may lend <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page60" id="v3page60"></a>60</span>themselves

      Plato now puts into the mouth of Parmenides &#8212; the advocate of One
      absolute and unchangeable Ens, separated by an impassable gulf
      from the sensible world of transitory and variable appearances or
      phenomena &#8212; objections against what is called the Platonic theory
      of Ideas: that is, the theory of an intelligible world, comprising
      an indefinite number of distinct intelligible and unchangeable
      Forms &#8212; in partial relation and communication with another world
      of sensible objects, each of which participates in one or more of
      these Forms. We thus have the Absolute One pitted against the

      What number and variety of these intelligible Forms do you

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_9"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_9"></a>Remarks upon this &#8212; Contrast between
        emotional and scientific classification.</span></p>
    <p>
      This remark deserves attention. Plato points out the radical
      distinction, and frequent antipathy between classifications
      constructed by science, and those which grow up spontaneously
      under the associating influence of a common emotion. What he calls
      &#8220;the opinions of men,&#8221; &#8212; in other words, the associations
      naturally working in an untaught and unlettered mind &#8212; bring
      together the ideas of objects according as they suggest a like
      emotion &#8212; veneration, love, fear, antipathy, contempt, laughter,
      &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_8" href="#Footnotev3_27_8"><span
          class="sp">8</span></a> As things which inspire like emotions
      are thrown into the same category and receive the same
      denomination, so the opposite proceeding inspires great
      repugnance, when things creating antipathetic emotions are forced
      into the same category. A large proportion of objects in nature
      come to be regarded as unworthy of any serious attention, and fit
      only to serve for discharging on them our laughter, contempt, or
      antipathy. The investigation of the structure and manifestations
      of insects is one of the marked features which Aristophanes
      ridicules in Sokrates: moreover the same poet also brings odium on
      the philosopher for alleged study of astronomy and meteorology &#8212;
      the heavenly bodies being as it were at the opposite emotional
      pole, objects of such reverential admiration and worship, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page62" id="v3page62"></a>62</span>that
      it was impious to watch or investigate them, or calculate their
      proceedings beforehand.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_9"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The extent
      to which anatomy and physiology were shut out from study in
      antiquity, and have continued to be partially so even in modern
      times, is well known. And the proportion of phenomena is both
      great and important, connected with the social relations, which
      are excluded both from formal registration and from scientific
      review; kept away from all rational analysis either of causes or
      remedies, because of the strong repugnances connected with them.
      This emotional view of nature is here noted by Plato as
      conflicting with the scientific. No object (he says) is mean in
      the eyes of philosophy. He remarks to the same effect in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, and the remark is illustrated by
      the classifying processes there exhibited:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_10" href="#Footnotev3_27_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> mean objects and esteemed objects
      being placed side by side. </p>

        Plato, himself, however, occasionally appeals &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#969;&#957;
        &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#962;, and becomes &#7936;&#964;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#8182;&#962; &#948;&#951;&#956;&#942;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;, when it suits his

        Both the Platonic Sokrates, and the Xenophontic Sokrates,
        frequently illustrate the education of men by comparison with
        the bringing up of young animals as well as with the training of
        horses: they also compare the educator of young men with the
        trainer of young horses. Indeed this comparison occurs so
        frequently, that it excites much displeasure among various
        modern critics (Forchhammer, K&ouml;chly, Socher, &amp;c.), who
        seem to consider it as unseemly and inconsistent with &#8220;the
        dignity of human nature&#8221;. The frequent allusions made by Plato
        to the homely arts and professions are noted by his
        interlocutors as tiresome.</p>

        The Zoological works of Aristotle exhibit a memorable example of
        scientific intelligence, overcoming all the contempt and disgust
        usually associated with minute and repulsive organisms. To
        Plato, it would be repugnant to arrange in the same class the
        wolf and the dog. See Sophist. p. 231 A.</p>

    <p>Parmenides now produces various objections against the Platonic
      variety of dualism: the two distinct but partially
      inter-communicating worlds &#8212; one, of separate, permanent,
      unchangeable, Forms or Ideas &#8212; the other, of individual objects,
      transient and variable; participating in, and receiving
      denomination from, these Forms. </p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_10"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_10"></a>Objections of Parmenides &#8212; How can
        objects participate in the Ideas. Each cannot have the whole
        Idea, nor a part thereof.</span></p>
    <p>
      1. How (asks Parmenides) can such participation take place? <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page63" id="v3page63"></a>63</span>Is
      the entire Form in each individual object? No: for one and the
      same Form cannot be at the same time in many distant objects. A
      part of it therefore must be in one object; another part in
      another. But this assumes that the Form is divisible &#8212; or is not
      essentially One. Equality is in all equal objects: but how can a
      part of the Form equality, less than the whole, make objects
      equal? Again, littleness is in all little objects: that is, a part
      of the Form littleness is in each. But the Form littleness cannot
      have parts; because, if it had, the entire Form would be greater
      than any of its parts, &#8212; and the Form littleness cannot be greater
      than any thing. Moreover, if one part of littleness were added to
      other parts, the sum of the two would be less, and not greater,
      than either of the factors. It is plain that none of these Forms
      can be divisible, or can have parts. Objects therefore cannot
      participate in the Form by parts or piecemeal. But neither can
      each object possess the entire Form. Accordingly, since there
      remains no third possibility, objects cannot participate in the
      Forms at all.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_11" href="#Footnotev3_27_11"><span

        Plato, Parmenid. p. 131. A similar argument, showing the
        impossibility of such &#956;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;, appears in Sextus Empiric. adv.

          id="Sidenotev3_27_11"></a>Comparing the Idea with the sensible
        objects partaking in the Idea, there is a likeness between them
        which must be represented by a higher Idea &#8212; and so on <i>ad
          infinitum</i>.</span></p>
    <p>
      2. Parmenides now passes to a second argument. The reason why you
      assume that each one of these Forms exists, is &#8212; That when you
      contemplate many similar objects, one and the same ideal phantom
      or Concept is suggested by all.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_12"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Thus,
      when you see many <i>great</i> objects, one common impression of
      <i>greatness</i> arises from all. Hence you conclude that The
      Great, or the Form of Greatness, exists as One. But if you take
      this Form of Greatness, and consider it in comparison with each or
      all the great individual objects, it will have in common with them
      something that makes it great. You must therefore search for some
      higher Form, which represents what belongs in common both to the
      Form of Greatness and to individual great objects. And this higher
      Form again, when compared with the rest, will have <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page64" id="v3page64"></a>64</span>something
      in common which must be represented by a Form yet higher: so that
      there will be an infinite series of Forms, ascending higher and
      higher, of which you will never reach the topmost.<a

        Plato, Parmenid. p. 132 A. See this process, of comparing the
        Form with particular objects denominated after the Form,
        described in a different metaphysical language by Mr. John
        Stuart Mill, System of Logic, book iv. ch. 2, sect. 3. &#8220;As the
        general conception is itself obtained by a comparison of
        particular phenomena, so, when obtained, the mode in which we
        apply it to other phenomena is again by comparison. We compare
        phenomena with each other to get the conception; and we then
        compare those and other phenomena <i>with</i> the conception.
        We get the conception of an animal by comparing different
        animals, and when we afterwards see a creature resembling an
        animal, we compare it with our general conception of an animal:
        and if it agrees with our general conception, we include it in
        the class. The conception becomes the type of comparison. We may
        perhaps find that no considerable number of other objects agree
        with this first general conception: and that we must drop the
        conception, and beginning again with a different individual
        case, proceed by fresh comparisons to a different general
        conception.&#8221;</p>

        The comparison, which the argument of the Platonic Parmenides
        assumes to be instituted, between &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; and &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;
        &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, is denied by Proklus; who says that there can be no
        comparison, nor any &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, except between &#964;&#8048; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#8134;: and
        that the Form is not &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#8050;&#962; with its participant particulars.

        considered as &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;, it is a forcible argument. See Aristot.
        Metaphys. A. 990, b. 15 seq., where it is numbered among &#959;&#7985;
        &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;. We find from the Scholion of Alexander
        (p. 566 Brandis), that it was advanced in several different ways
        by Aristotle, in his work &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7992;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957;: by his scholar Eudemus &#7952;&#957;
        &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#923;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962;: and by a contemporary &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; named
        Polyxenus, as well as by other Sophists.</p>

    <p>
      3. Perhaps (suggests Sokrates) each of these Forms is a Conception
      of the mind and nothing beyond: the Form is not competent to exist
      out of the mind.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_14"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> How?
      (replies Parmenides.) There cannot be in the mind any Conception,
      which is a Conception of nothing. Every Conception must be of
      something really existing: in this case, it is a Conception of
      some one thing, which you conceive as belonging in common to each
      and all the objects considered. The Something thus conceived as
      perpetually One and the same in all, is, the Form. Besides, if you
      think that individual objects participate in the Forms, and that
      these Forms are Conceptions of the mind, &#8212; you must suppose,
      either that all <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page65"
          id="v3page65"></a>65</span>objects are made up of Conceptions,
      and are therefore themselves Concipients: or else that these
      Forms, though Conceptions, are incapable of conceiving. Neither
      one nor the other is admissible.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_15"

    <p>
      4. Probably the case stands thus (says Sokrates). These Forms are
      constants and fixtures in nature, as models or patterns.
      Particular objects are copies or likenesses of them: and the
      participation of such objects in the Form consists in being made
      like to it.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_16" href="#Footnotev3_27_16"><span
          class="sp">16</span></a> In that case (replies Parmenides),
      the Form must itself be like to the objects which have been made
      like to it. Comparing the Form with the objects, that in which
      they resemble must itself be a Form: and thus you will have a
      higher Form above the first Form &#8212; and so upwards in the ascending
      line. This follows necessarily from the hypothesis that the Form
      is like the objects. The participation of objects in the Form,
      therefore, cannot consist in being likened to it.<a

        Aristotle (Metaphys. A. 991, a. 20) characterises this way of

    <p>
      5. Here are grave difficulties (continues Parmenides) opposed to
      this doctrine of yours, affirming the existence of self-existent,
      substantive, unchangeable, yet participated, Forms. But
      difficulties still graver remain behind. Such Forms as you
      describe cannot be cognizable by us: at least it is hard to show
      how they can be cognizable. Being self-existent and substantive,
      they are not <i>in us</i>: such of them as are relative, have
      their relation with each other, not with those particular objects
      among us, which are called <i>great</i>, <i>little</i>, and so
      forth, from being supposed to be similar to or participant in the
      forms, and bearing names the same as those of the Forms. Thus, for
      example, if I, an individual man, am in the relation of master, I
      bear that relation to another individual<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page66" id="v3page66"></a>66</span> man who is my
      servant, not to servantship in general (<i>i.e.</i> the Form of
      servantship, the <i>Servus per se</i>). My servant, again, bears
      the relation of servant to me, an individual man as master, &#8212; not
      to mastership in general (<i>i.e.</i> to the Form of mastership,
      the <i>Dominus per se</i>). Both terms of the relation are
      individual objects. On the other hand, the Forms also bear
      relation to each other. The Form of servantship (<i>Servus per se</i>)
      stands in relation to the Form of mastership (<i>Dominus per se</i>).
      Neither of them correlates with an individual object. The two
      terms of the relation must be homogeneous, each of them a Form.<a

        Form of Cognition, which we do not possess.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now apply this to the case of cognition. The Form of Cognition
      correlates exclusively with the Form of Truth: the Form of each
      special Cognition, geometrical or medical, or other, correlates
      with the Form of Geometry or Medicine. But Cognition as we possess
      it, correlates only with Truth relatively to us: also, each
      special Cognition of ours has its special correlating Truth,
      relatively to us.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_19"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Now the
      Forms are not in or with us, but apart from us: the Form of
      Cognition is not our Cognition, the Form of Truth is not our
      Truth. Forms can be known only through the Form of Cognition,
      which <i>we</i> do not possess: we cannot therefore know Forms.
      We have our own cognition, whereby we know what is relative to us;
      but we know nothing more. Forms, which are not relative to us, lie
      out of our knowledge. <i>Bonum per se, Pulchrum per se</i>, and
      the other self-existent Forms or Ideas, are to us altogether
      unknowable.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_20" href="#Footnotev3_27_20"><span

        Aristotle (Topica, vi. p. 147, a. 6) adverts to this as an

        &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;, which nevertheless men often wish for, and he remarks,

      6. Again, if there be a real self-existent Form of Cognition,
      apart from that which we or others possess &#8212; it must doubtless be
      far superior in accuracy and perfection <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page67" id="v3page67"></a>67</span>to that which we
      possess.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_21" href="#Footnotev3_27_21"><span
          class="sp">21</span></a> The Form of Beauty and the other
      Forms, must be in like manner superior to that which is found
      under the same name in individual objects. This perfect Form of
      Cognition must therefore belong to the Gods, if it belong to any
      one. But if so, the Gods must have a Form of Truth, the proper
      object of their Form of Cognition. They cannot know the truth
      relatively to us, which belongs to <i>our</i> cognition &#8212; any
      more than we can know the more perfect truth belonging to them. So
      too about other Forms. The perfect Form of mastership belongs to
      the Gods, correlating with its proper Form of servantship. <i>Their</i>
      mastership does not correlate with individual objects like us: in
      other words, they are not our masters, nor are we their servants.
      <i>Their</i> cognition, again, does not correlate with individual
      objects like us: in other words, they do not know us, nor do we
      know them. In like manner, we in our capacity of masters are not
      masters of them &#8212; we as cognizant beings know nothing of them or
      of that which they know. They can in no way correlate with us, nor
      can we correlate with them.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_22"

        The inference here drawn by Parmenides supplies the first
        mention of a doctrine revived by (if not transmitted to)
        Averroes and various scholastic doctors of the middle ages, so
        as to be formally condemned by theological councils. M. Renan
        tells us &#8212; &#8220;En 1269, &Eacute;tienne Tempier, &eacute;v&ecirc;que
        de Paris, ayant rassembl&eacute; le conseil des ma&icirc;tres en
        th&eacute;ologie &#8230; condamna, de concert avec eux, treize
        propositions qui ne sont presque toutes que les axiomes
        familiers de l&#8217;averro&iuml;sme: Quod intellectus hominum est
        unus et idem numero. Quod mundus est &aelig;ternus. Quod nunquam
        fuit primus homo. <i>Quod Deus non cognoscit singularia</i>,&#8221;
        &amp;c. (Renan, Averro&egrave;s, p. 213, 2nd ed., p. 268.)</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_27_18"></a>Dilemma put by Parmenides &#8212;
        Acuteness of his objections.</span></p>
    <p>
      Here then, Parmenides entangles himself and his auditors in the
      perplexing dilemma, that philosophical and dialectic speculation
      is impossible, unless these Forms or Ideas, together with the
      participation of sensible objects in them, be granted; while at
      the same time this cannot be granted, until objections, which
      appear at first sight unanswerable, have been disposed of.</p>
    <p>
      The acuteness with which these objections are enforced, is
      remarkable. I know nothing superior to it in all the Platonic
      writings. Moreover the objections point directly against that
      doctrine which Plato in other dialogues most emphatically insists
      upon, and which Aristotle both announces and combats as
      characteristic of Plato &#8212; the doctrine of separate, self-existent,
      absolute, Forms or Ideas. They are addressed moreover to Sokrates,
      the chief exponent of that doctrine here as well as in other
      dialogues. And he is depicted as unable to meet them.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_19"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_19"></a>The doctrine which Parmenides
        attacks is the genuine Platonic theory of Ideas. His objections
        are never answered in any part of the Platonic dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is true that Sokrates is here introduced as juvenile and
      untrained; or at least as imperfectly trained. And accordingly,
      Stallbaum with others think, that this is the reason of his
      inability to meet the objections: which (they tell us), though
      ingenious and plausible, yet having no application to the genuine
      Platonic doctrine about Ideas, might easily have been answered if
      Plato had thought fit, and are answered in other <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page69" id="v3page69"></a>69</span>dialogues.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_25" href="#Footnotev3_27_25"><span
          class="sp">25</span></a> But to me it appears, that the
      doctrine which is challenged in the Parmenid&ecirc;s is the
      genuine Platonic doctrine about Ideas, as enunciated by Plato in
      the Republic, Ph&aelig;don, Phil&ecirc;bus, Tim&aelig;us, and
      elsewhere &#8212; though a very different doctrine is announced in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s. Objections are here made against it in the
      Parmenid&ecirc;s. In what other dialogue has Plato answered them?
      and what proof can be furnished that he was able to answer them?
      There are indeed many other dialogues in which a real world of
      Ideas absolute and unchangeable, is affirmed strenuously and
      eloquently, with various consequences and accompaniments traced to
      it: but there are none in which the Parmenidean objections are
      elucidated, or even recited. In the Ph&aelig;don, Ph&aelig;drus,
      Tim&aelig;us, Symposion, &amp;c., and elsewhere, Sokrates is made
      to talk confidently about the existence and even about the
      cognoscibility of these Ideas; just as if no such objections as
      those which we read in the Parmenid&ecirc;s could be produced.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_26" href="#Footnotev3_27_26"><span
          class="sp">26</span></a> In these other dialogues, Plato
      accepts implicitly one horn of the Parmenidean dilemma; but
      without explaining to us upon what grounds he allows himself to
      neglect the other.</p>

        According to Stallbaum (Prolegg. pp. 277-337) the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s is the only dialogue in which Plato has
        discussed, with philosophical exactness, the theory of Ideas; in
        all the other dialogues he handles it in a popular and
        superficial manner. There is truth in this &#8212; indeed more truth
        (I think) than Stallbaum himself supposed: otherwise he would
        hardly have said that the objections in the Parmenides could
        easily have been answered, if Plato had chosen.</p>
      <p>
        Stallbaum tells us, not only respecting Socher but respecting
        Schleiermacher (pp. 324-332), &#8220;Parmenidem omnino non
        intellexit&#8221;. In my judgment, Socher understands the dialogue
        better than Stallbaum, when he (Socher) says, that the
        objections in the first half bear against the genuine Platonic
        Ideas; though I do not agree with his inference about the
        spuriousness of the dialogue.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_20"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_20"></a>Views of Stallbaum and Socher. The
        latter maintains that Plato would never make such objections
        against his own theory, and denies the authenticity of the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s.</span></p>
    <p>
      Socher has so much difficulty in conceiving that Plato can have
      advanced such forcible objections against a doctrine, which
      nevertheless in other Platonic dialogues is proclaimed as true and
      important, &#8212; that he declares the Parmenid&ecirc;s (together with
      the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus) not to be genuine, but to have
      been composed by some unknown Megaric contemporary. To pass over
      the improbability that any unknown author should have been capable
      of composing works of so much ability as these &#8212; Socher&#8217;s decision
      about spuriousness is founded upon an estimate of Plato&#8217;s
      philosophical character, which I think incorrect. Socher <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page70" id="v3page70"></a>70</span>expects
      (or at least reasons as if he expected) to find in Plato a
      preconceived system and a scheme of conclusions to which every
      thing is made subservient.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_21"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_21"></a>Philosophers are usually advocates,
        each of a positive system of his own.</span></p>
    <p>
      In most philosophers, doubtless, this is what we do find. Each
      starts with some favourite conclusions, which he believes to be
      true, and which he supports by all the arguments in their favour,
      as far as his power goes. If he mentions the arguments against
      them, he usually answers the weak, slurs over or sneers at the
      strong: at any rate, he takes every precaution that these counter
      arguments shall appear unimportant in the eyes of his readers. His
      purpose is, like that of a speaker in the public assembly, to
      obtain assent and belief: whether the hearers understand the
      question or not, is a matter of comparative indifference: at any
      rate, they must be induced to embrace his conclusion. Unless he
      thus foregoes the character of an impartial judge, to take up that
      of an earnest advocate; unless he bends the whole force of his
      mind to the establishment of the given conclusion &#8212; he becomes
      suspected as deficient in faith or sincerity, and loses much in
      persuasive power. For an earnest belief, expressed with eloquence
      and feeling, is commonly more persuasive than any logic.</p>

        Dialogues of Search.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now whether this exclusive devotion to the affirmative side of
      certain questions be the true spirit of philosophy or not, it is
      certainly not the spirit of Plato in his Dialogues of Search;
      wherein he conceives the work of philosophy in a totally different
      manner. He does not begin by stating, even to himself a certain
      conclusion at which he has arrived, and then proceed to prove that
      conclusion to others. The search or debate (as I have observed in
      a preceding <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_8_27">chapter</a>)
      has greater importance in his eyes than the conclusion: nay, in a
      large proportion of his dialogues, there is no conclusion at all:
      we see something disproved, but nothing proved. The negative
      element has with him a value and importance of its own, apart from
      the affirmative. He is anxious to set forth what can be said
      against a given conclusion; even though not prepared to establish
      any thing in its place.</p>

        manifestation of the negative element. That Plato should employ
        one dialogue in setting forth the negative case against the
        Theory of Ideas is not unnatural.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such negative element, manifested as it is in so many of the
      Platonic dialogues, has its extreme manifestation in the
      Parmenid&ecirc;s. When we see it here applied to a doctrine which
      Plato in other dialogues insists upon as truth, we must call to
      mind (what sincere believers are apt to forget) that a case may
      always be made out against truth as well as in its favour: and
      that its privilege as a certified portion of &#8220;reasoned truth,&#8221;
      rests upon no better title than the superiority of the latter case
      over the former. It is for testing the two cases &#8212; for determining
      where the superiority lies &#8212; and for graduating its amount &#8212; that
      the process of philosophising is called for, and that improvements
      in the method thereof become desirable. That Plato should, in one
      of his many diversified dialogues, apply this test to a doctrine
      which, in other dialogues, he holds out as true &#8212; is noway
      inconsistent with the general spirit of these compositions. Each
      of his dialogues has its own point of view, worked out on that
      particular occasion; what is common to them all, is the process of
      philosophising applied in various ways to the same general topics.</p>
    <p>
      Those who, like Socher, deny Plato&#8217;s authorship of the
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, on the ground of what is urged therein against
      the theory of Ideas, must suppose, either that he did not know
      that a negative case could be made out against that theory; or
      that knowing it, he refrained from undertaking the duty.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_27" href="#Footnotev3_27_27"><span
          class="sp">27</span></a> Neither supposition is consistent
      with what we know both of his negative ingenuity, and of his
      multifarious manner of handling.</p>

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 14, where the distinction taken
        coincides accurately enough with that which we read in Plato,
        Parmenid. p. 129 A-D.</p>
      <p>
        Str&uuml;mpell thinks that the Parmenid&ecirc;s was composed at
        a time of Plato&#8217;s life when he had become sensible of the
        difficulties and contradictions attaching to his doctrine of
        self-existent Forms or Ideas, and when he was looking about for
        some way of extrication from them: which way he afterwards
        thought that he found in that approximation to Pythagorism &#8212;
        that exchange of Ideas for Ideal numbers, &amp;c. &#8212; which we
        find imputed to him by Aristotle (Gesch. der Griech. Phil. sect.
        96, 3). This is not impossible; but I find no sufficient ground
        for affirming it. Nor can I see how the doctrine which Aristotle
        ascribes to Plato about the Ideas (that they are generated by
        two &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945; or elements, &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957; along with &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;
        &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#957;) affords any escape from the difficulties started in the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s.</p>

        Str&uuml;mpell considers the dialogue Parmenid&ecirc;s to have

        Parmenid&ecirc;s. Difficulties about participation of sensible
        objects in the world of Ideas.</span></p>
    <p>
      The negative case, made out in the Parmenid&ecirc;s against the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page72" id="v3page72"></a>72</span>theory
      of Ideas, is indeed most powerful. The hypothesis of the Ideal
      World is unequivocally affirmed by Sokrates, with its four
      principal characteristics. 1. Complete essential separation from
      the world of sense. 2. Absolute self-existence. 3. Plurality of
      constituent items, several contrary to each other. 4. Unchangeable
      sameness and unity of each and all of them. &#8212; Here we have full
      satisfaction given to the Platonic sentiment, which often delights
      in soaring above the world of sense, and sometimes (see
      Ph&aelig;don) in heaping contemptuous metaphors upon it. But
      unfortunately Sokrates cannot disengage himself from this world of
      sense: he is obliged to maintain that it partakes of, or is
      determined by, these extra-sensible Forms or Ideas. Here commence
      the series of difficulties and contradictions brought out by the
      Elenchus of Parmenides. Are all sensible objects, even such as are
      vulgar, repulsive, and contemptible, represented in this higher
      world? The Platonic sentiment shrinks from the admission: the
      Platonic sense of analogy hesitates to deny it. Then again, how
      can both assertions be true &#8212; first that the two worlds are
      essentially separate, next, that the one participates in, and
      derives its essence from, the other? How (to use Aristotelian
      language<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_28" href="#Footnotev3_27_28"><span
          class="sp">28</span></a>) can the essence be separated from
      that of which it is the essence? How can the Form, essentially
      One, belong at once to a multitude of particulars?</p>

        of Ideas. If Ideas are absolute, they cannot be cognizable: if
        they are cognizable, they must be relative. Doctrine of Homo

    <p>
      1. Parmenides shows, and Sokrates does not deny, that these Forms
      or Ideas described as absolute, self-existent, unchangeable, must
      of necessity be unknown and unknowable to us.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_29" href="#Footnotev3_27_29"><span

      declare it to be neither known nor knowable by us: if it be
      announced as known or knowable by us, it is thereby implied at the
      same time not to be absolute. If these Forms or Objects called
      absolute are known, they can be known only by an absolute Subject,
      or the Form of a cognizant Subject: that is, by God or the Gods.
      Even thus, to call them <i>absolute</i> is a misnomer: they are
      relative to the Subject, and the Subject is relative to them.</p>

    <p>
      The opinion here advanced by the Platonic Parmenides asserts, in
      other words, what is equivalent to the memorable dictum of
      Protagoras &#8212; &#8220;Man is the measure of all things &#8212; of things
      existent, that they do exist &#8212; and of things non-existent, that
      they do not exist&#8221;. This dictum affirms universal relativity, and
      nothing else: though Plato, as we shall see in the elaborate
      argument against it delivered by Sokrates in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, mixed it up with another doctrine
      altogether distinct and independent &#8212; the doctrine that knowledge
      is sensible perception.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_30"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
      Parmenides here argues that if these Forms or Ideas are known by
      us, they can be known only as relative to us: and that if they be
      not relative to us, they cannot be known by us at all. Such
      relativity belongs as much to the world of Conception, as to the
      world of Perception. And it is remarkable that Plato admits this
      essential relativity not merely here, but also in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s: in which latter dialogue he denies the Forms or
      Ideas to be absolute existences, on the special ground that they
      are known:&#8212; and on the farther ground that what is known must act
      upon the knowing mind, and must be acted upon thereby, <i>i.e.</i>,
      must be relative. He there defines the existent to be, that which
      has power to act upon something else, or to be acted upon by
      something else. Such relativeness he declares to constitute <i>existence</i>:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_31" href="#Footnotev3_27_31"><span
          class="sp">31</span></a> defining existence to mean

    <p>
      2. The second point which deserves notice in this portion of the
      Parmenid&ecirc;s, is the answer of Sokrates (when embarrassed by
      some of the questions of the Eleatic <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page74" id="v3page74"></a>74</span>veteran) &#8212; &#8220;That
      these Forms or Ideas are conceptions of the mind, and have no
      existence out of the mind&#8221;. This answer gives us the purely
      Subjective, or negation of Object: instead of the purely Objective
      (Absolute), or negation of Subject.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_32"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Here we
      have what Porphyry calls the deepest question of philosophy<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_33" href="#Footnotev3_27_33"><span
          class="sp">33</span></a> explicitly raised: and, as far as we
      know, for the first time. Are the Forms or Ideas mere conceptions
      of the mind and nothing more? Or are they external, separate,
      self-existent realities? The opinion which Sokrates had first
      given declared the latter: that which he now gives declares the
      former. He passes from the pure Objective (<i>i.e.</i>, without
      Subject) to the pure Subjective (<i>i.e.</i>, without Object).
      Parmenides, in his reply, points out that there cannot be a
      conception of nothing: that if there be Conceptio, there must be <i>Conceptum
        aliquid</i>:<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_34" href="#Footnotev3_27_34"><span
          class="sp">34</span></a> and that this Conceptum or Concept is

        The following passage in the learned work of Cudworth bears on
        the portion of the Parmenid&ecirc;s which we are now
        considering. Cudworth, Treatise of Immutable Morality, pp.
        243-245.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;But if any one demand here, where this &#7936;&#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, these
        immutable Entities do exist? I answer, first, that as they are
        considered formally, they do not properly exist in the
        Individuals without us, as if they were from them imprinted upon
        the Understanding, which some have taken to be Aristotle&#8217;s
        opinion; because no Individual Material thing is either
        Universal or Immutable.&#8230; Because they perish not together with
        them, it is a certain argument that they exist independently
        upon them. Neither, in the next place, do they exist somewhere
        else apart from the Individual Sensibles, and without the Mind,
        which is that opinion that Aristotle justly condemns, but either
        unjustly or unskilfully attributes to Plato.&#8230; Wherefore these
        Intelligible Ideas or Essences of Things, those Forms by which
        we understand all Things, exist nowhere but in the mind itself;
        for it was very well determined long ago by Socrates, in Plato&#8217;s
        Parmenid&ecirc;s, that these things are nothing else but
        Noemata: &#8216;These Species or Ideas are all of them nothing but
        Noemata or Notions that exist nowhere but in the Soul itself&#8217;.&#8230;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;And yet notwithstanding, though these Things exist only in the
        Mind, they are not therefore mere Figments of the
        Understanding.&#8230;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;It is evident that though the Mind thinks of these Things at
        pleasure, yet they are not arbitrarily framed by the Mind, but
        have certain, determinate, and immutable Natures of their own,
        which are independent upon the Mind, and which are blown
        (qu&aelig;re <i>not blown</i>) away into Nothing at the
        pleasure of the same Being that arbitrarily made them.&#8221; </p>
      <p>
        It is an inadvertence on the part of Cudworth to cite this
        passage of the Parmenid&ecirc;s as authenticating Plato&#8217;s
        opinion that Forms or Ideas existed only in the mind. Certainly
        Sokrates is here made to express that opinion, among others; but
        the opinion is refuted by Parmenid&ecirc;s and dropped by
        Sokrates. But the very different opinion, which Cudworth accuses
        Aristotle of <i>wrongly</i> attributing to Plato, is repeated
        by Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;don, Republic, and elsewhere, and
        never refuted.</p>

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page75" id="v3page75"></a>75</span>This
      reply, though scanty and undeveloped, is in my judgment both
      valid, as it negatives the Subject pure and simple, and affirms
      that to every conception in the mind, there must correspond a
      Concept out of (or rather along with) the mind (the one
      correlating with or implying the other) &#8212; and correct as far as it
      goes, in declaring what that Concept is. Such Concept is, or may
      be, the Form. Parmenides does not show that it is not so. He
      proceeds to impugn, by a second argument, the assertion of
      Sokrates &#8212; that the form is a Conception <i>wholly within</i> the
      mind: he goes on to argue that individual things (which are <i>out</i>
      of the mind) cannot participate in these Forms (which are asserted
      to be altogether <i>in</i> the mind): because, if that were
      admitted, either every such thing must be a Concipient, or must
      run into the contradiction of being a <i>Conceptio non concipiens</i>.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_35" href="#Footnotev3_27_35"><span
          class="sp">35</span></a> Now this argument may refute the
      affirmation of Sokrates literally taken, that the Form is a
      Conception entirely belonging to the mind, and having nothing
      Objective corresponding to it &#8212; but does not refute the doctrine
      that the Form is a Concept correlating with the mind &#8212; or out of
      the mind as well as in it. In this as in other Concepts, the
      subjective point of view preponderates over the objective, though
      Object is not altogether eliminated: just as, in the particular
      external things, the objective point of view predominates, though
      Subject cannot be altogether dismissed. Neither Subject nor Object
      can ever entirely disappear: the one is the inseparable
      correlative and complement of the other: but sometimes the
      subjective point of view may preponderate, sometimes<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page76" id="v3page76"></a>76</span>
      the objective. Such preponderance (or logical priority), either of
      the one or the other, may be implied or connoted by the
      denomination given. Though the special connotation of the name
      creates an illusion which makes the preponderant point of view
      seem to be all, and magnifies the Relatum so as to eclipse and
      extinguish the Correlatum &#8212; yet such preponderance, or logical
      priority, is all that is really meant when the Concepts are said
      to be &#8220;<i>in the mind</i>&#8221; &#8212; and the Percepts (Percepta, things
      perceived) to be &#8220;<i>out of the mind</i>&#8221;: for both Concepts and
      Percepts are &#8220;<i>of the mind</i>, or <i>relative to the mind</i>&#8221;.<a

        On this point the argument in the dialogue itself, as stated by
        Parmenides, is not clear to follow. Str&uuml;mpell remarks on

        This preponderance of the Objective point of view, though
        without altogether eliminating the Subjective, includes all that
        is true in the assertion of Aristotle, that the <i>Perceptum</i>
        is prior to the <i>Percipient</i> &#8212; the <i>Percipiendum</i>
        prior to the <i>Perceptionis Capax</i>. He assimilates the
        former to a <i>Movens</i>, the latter to a <i>Motum</i>. But
        he declares that he means not a priority in time or real
        existence, but simply a <i>priority in nature</i> or <i>logical
          priority</i>; and he also declares the two to be relatives or
        reciproca. The Prius is relative to the Posterius, as the

        Terms, debated from ancient times to the present day &#8212; Different
        views of Plato and Aristotle upon it.</span></p>
    <p>
      The question &#8212; What is the real and precise meaning attached to
      abstract and general words? &#8212; has been debated down to this day,
      and is still under debate. It seems to have first derived its
      importance, if not its origin, from Sokrates, who began the
      practice of inviting persons to define the familiar generalities
      of ethics and politics, and then tested by cross-examination the
      definitions given by men who thought that common sense would
      enable any one to define.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_37"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> But I
      see no ground for believing that Sokrates ever put to himself the
      question &#8212; Whether that which an abstract term denotes is a mental
      conception, or a separate and self-existent reality. That question
      was raised by Plato, and first stands clearly brought to view here
      in the Parmenid&ecirc;s.</p>

    <p>
      If we follow up the opinion here delivered by the Platonic
      Sokrates, together with the first correction added to it by
      Parmenides, amounting to this &#8212; That the Form is a Conception of
      the mind with its corresponding Concept: if, besides, we dismiss
      the doctrine held by Plato, that the Form is a separate
      self-existent<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page77"
          id="v3page77"></a>77</span> unchangeable Ens (&#7955;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#964;&#8048;
      &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048;): there will then be no greater difficulty in understanding
      how it can be partaken by, or be at once in, many distinct
      particulars, than in understanding (what is at bottom the same
      question) how one and the same attribute can belong at once to
      many different objects: how hardness or smoothness can be at once
      in an indefinite number of hard and smooth bodies dispersed
      everywhere.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_38" href="#Footnotev3_27_38"><span
          class="sp">38</span></a> The object and the attribute are both
      of them relative to the same percipient and concipient mind: we
      may perceive or conceive many objects as distinct individuals &#8212; we
      may also conceive them all as resembling in a particular manner,
      making abstraction of the individuality of each: both these are
      psychological facts, and the latter of the two is what we mean
      when we say, that all of them possess or participate in one and
      the same attribute. The concrete term, and its corresponding
      abstract, stand for the same facts of sense differently conceived.
      Now the word <i>one</i>, when applied to the attribute, has a
      different meaning from <i>one</i> when applied to an individual
      object. Plato speaks sometimes elsewhere as if he felt this
      diversity of meaning: not however in the Parmenid&ecirc;s, though
      there is great demand for it. But Aristotle (in this respect far
      superior) takes much pains to point out that <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page78" id="v3page78"></a>78</span><i>Unum
        Ens</i> &#8212; and the preposition <i>In</i> (to be <i>in</i> any
      thing) &#8212; are among the &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, having several different
      meanings derived from one primary or radical by diverse and
      distant ramifications.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_39"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> The
      important logical distinction between <i>Unum numero</i> and <i>Unum
        specie</i> (or <i>genere</i>, &amp;c.) belongs first to
      Aristotle.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_40" href="#Footnotev3_27_40"><span

        That &#8220;the attribute is in its subject,&#8221; is explained by
        Aristotle only by saying That it is <i>in</i> its subject, not
        as a part in the whole, yet as that which cannot exist apart
        from its subject (Categor. 1, a. 30-3, a. 30). Compare Hobbes,
        Comput. or Logic. iii. 3, viii. 3. Respecting the number of
        different modes &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7956;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, see Aristot. Physic. iii. p.
        210, a. 18 seq., with the Scholia, p. 373 Brandis, and p. 446,
        10 Brand. The commentators made out, variously, nine, eleven,
        sixteen distinct &#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7956;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;. In the language of
        Aristotle, <i>genus</i>, <i>species</i>, &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;, and even <i>differentia</i>
        are not &#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;, but are predicated &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965; (see
        Cat. p. 3, a. 20). The <i>proprium</i> and <i>accidens</i>
        alone are &#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;. Here is a difference between his
        language and that of Plato, according to whom &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; is &#7952;&#957;
        &#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#8179; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8182;&#957; (Parmenid. 131 A). But we remark in that same
        dialogue, that when Parmenides questions Sokrates whether he
        recognises &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940; he first asks whether Sokrates
        admits &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#972;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;,
        &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;. Sokrates answers without hesitation, <i>Yes</i>.
        Then Parmenides proceeds to ask, Do you recognise an &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; of
        man, separate and apart from all of us individual men? &#8212; or an
        &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; of fire, water, and such like? Here Sokrates hesitates: he
        will neither admit nor deny it (130 D). The first list, which
        Sokrates at once accepts, is of what Aristotle would call <i>accidents</i>:
        the second, which Sokrates doubts about, is of what Aristotle
        would call <i>second substances</i>. We thus see that the
        conception of a self-existent &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; realised itself most easily
        and distinctly to the mind of Plato in the case of <i>accidents</i>.
        He would, therefore, naturally conceive &#964;&#8048; &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; as being &#7952;&#957;
        &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;, agreeing substantially, though not in terms, with
        Aristotle. It is in the case of accidents or attributes that
        abstract names are most usually invented; and it is the abstract
        name, or the neuter adjective used as its equivalent, which
        suggests the belief in an &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;.</p>

        About abstract names, or the names of attributes, see Mr. John
        Stuart Mill&#8217;s &#8216;System of Logic,&#8217; i. 2, 4, p. 30, edit. 5th.
        &#8220;When only one attribute, neither variable in degree nor in
        kind, is designated by the name &#8212; as visibleness, tangibleness,
        equality, &amp;c. &#8212; though it denotes an attribute of many
        different objects, the attribute itself is always considered as
        <i>one</i>, not as <i>many</i>.&#8221; Compare, also, on this point,
        p. 153, and a note added by Mr. Mill to the fifth edition, p.
        203, in reply to Mr. Herbert Spencer. The <i>oneness</i> of the
        attribute, in different subjects, is not conceded by every one.
        Mr. Spencer thinks that the same abstract word denotes one
        attribute in Subject A, and another attribute, though exactly
        like it, in Subject B (Principles of Psychology, p. 126 seq.)
        Mr. Mill&#8217;s view appears the correct one; but the distinction
        (pointed out by Archbishop Whately) between <i>undistinguishable
          likeness</i> and <i>positive identity</i>, becomes in these
        cases imperceptible or forgotten.</p>
      <p>
        Aristotle, however, in the beginning of the Categories ranks &#7969;
        &#964;&#943;&#962; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; as &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; <span class="gesp">&#7955;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8183;</span>
        (pp. 1, 6, 8), which I do not understand; and it seems opposed
        to another passage, pp. 3, 6, 15. </p>
      <p>
        The argument between two such able thinkers as Mr. Mill and Mr.
        Spencer, illustrates forcibly the extreme nicety of this
        question respecting the One and the Many, under certain
        supposable circumstances. We cannot be surprised that it puzzled
        the dialecticians of the Platonic Aristotelian age, who fastened
        by preference on points of metaphysical difficulty.</p>

        Ideas fit on to the facts of sense: Aristotle tried to do it and
        partly succeeded.</span></p>
    <p>
      Plato has not followed out the hint which he has here put into the
      mouth of Sokrates in the Parmenid&ecirc;s &#8212; That the Ideas or
      Forms are conceptions existing only in the mind. Though the
      opinion thus stated is not strictly correct (and is so pointed out
      by himself), as falling back too exclusively on the subjective &#8212;
      yet if followed out, it might have served to modify the too
      objective and absolute character which in most dialogues (though
      not in the Sophist&ecirc;s) he ascribes to his Forms or Ideas:
      laying stress upon them as objects &#8212; and as objects not of
      sensible perception &#8212; but overlooking or disallowing the fact of
      their being relative to the concipient mind. The bent of Plato&#8217;s
      philosophy was to dwell upon these Forms, and to bring them into
      harmonious conjunction with each other: he neither took pains, nor
      expected, to make them fit on to the world of sense. With
      Aristotle, on the contrary, this last-mentioned purpose is kept
      very generally in view. Amidst all the extreme abstractions <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page79" id="v3page79"></a>79</span>which
      he handles, he reverts often to the comparison of them with
      sensible particulars: indeed Substantia Prima was by him, for the
      first time in the history of philosophy, brought down to designate
      the concrete particular object of sense: in Plato&#8217;s Ph&aelig;don,
      Republic, &amp;c, the only Substances are the Forms or Ideas.</p>

        Parmenides admonishes Sokrates that he has been premature in
        delivering a doctrine, without sufficient preliminary exercise.</span></p>
    <p>
      Parmenides now continues the debate. He has already fastened upon
      Sokrates several difficult problems: he now proposes a new one,
      different and worse. Which way are we to turn then, if these Forms
      be beyond our knowledge? I do not see my way (says Sokrates) out
      of the perplexity. The fact is, Sokrates (replies Parmenides), you
      have been too forward in producing your doctrine of Ideas, without
      a sufficient preliminary exercise and enquiry. Your love of
      philosophical research is highly praiseworthy: but you must employ
      your youth in exercising and improving yourself, through that
      continued philosophical discourse which the vulgar call <i>useless
        prosing</i>: otherwise you will never attain truth.<a

        describes: To assume provisionally both the affirmative and the
        negative of many hypotheses about the most general terms, and to
        trace the consequences of each.</span></p>
    <p>
      What sort of exercise must I go through? asks Sokrates. Zeno
      (replies Parmenides) has already given you a good specimen of it
      in his treatise, when he followed out the consequences flowing
      from the assumption &#8212; &#8220;That the self-existent and absolute Ens is
      plural&#8221;. When you are trying to find out the truth on any
      question, you must assume provisionally, first the affirmative and
      then the negative, and you must then follow out patiently the
      consequences deducible from one hypothesis as well as from the
      other. If you are enquiring about the Form of Likeness, whether it
      exists or does not exist, you must assume successively <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page80" id="v3page80"></a>80</span>both
      one and the other;<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_43"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> marking
      the deductions which follow, both with reference to the thing
      directly assumed, and with reference to other things also. You
      must do the like if you are investigating other Forms &#8212;
      Unlikeness, Motion, and Rest, or even Existence and Non-Existence.
      But you must not be content with following out only one side of
      the hypothesis: you must examine both sides with equal care and
      impartiality. This is the only sort of preparatory exercise which
      will qualify you for completely seeing through the truth.<a

    <p>
      The remaining portion of the dialogue, half of the whole, is
      occupied with nine distinct deductions or demonstrations given by
      Parmenides. The first five start from the assumption, <i>Unum Est</i>:
      the last four from the assumption, <i>Unum non Est</i>. The three
      first draw out the deductions from <i>Unum Est</i>, in reference
      to <i>Unum</i>: the fourth and fifth draw out the consequences
      from the same premiss, in reference to <i>C&aelig;tera</i>.
      Again, the sixth and seventh start from <i>Unum non Est</i>, to
      trace what follows in regard to <i>Unum</i>: the eighth and ninth
      adopt the same hypothesis, and reason it out in reference to <i>C&aelig;tera</i>.</p>

        pairs, or Antinomies. Perplexing entanglement of conclusions
        given without any explanation.</span></p>
    <p>
      Of these demonstrations, one characteristic feature is, that they
      are presented in antagonising pairs or Antinomies: except the
      third, which professes to mediate between the first and second,
      though only by introducing new difficulties. We have four distinct
      Antinomies: the first and second, the fourth and fifth, the sixth
      and seventh, the eighth and ninth, stand respectively in emphatic
      contradiction with each other. Moreover, to take the
      demonstrations separately &#8212; the first, fifth, seventh, ninth, end
      in conclusions purely negative: the other four end in double and
      contradictory conclusions. The purpose is formally proclaimed, of
      showing that the same premisses, ingeniously handled, can be made
      to yield these contradictory results.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_47"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> No
      attempt is made to reconcile the contradictions, except partially
      by means of the third, in reference to the two preceding. In
      regard to the fourth and fifth, sixth and seventh, eighth and
      ninth, no hint is given that they <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page82" id="v3page82"></a>82</span>can be, or
      afterwards will be, reconciled. The dialogue concludes abruptly at
      the end of the ninth demonstration, with these words: &#8220;We thus see
      that &#8212; whether Unum exists or does not exist &#8212; Unum and
      C&aelig;tera both are, and are not, all things in every way &#8212; both
      appear, and do not appear, all things in every way &#8212; each in
      relation to itself, and each in relation to the other&#8221;.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_48" href="#Footnotev3_27_48"><span
          class="sp">48</span></a> Here is an unqualified and even
      startling announcement of double and contradictory conclusions,
      obtained from the same premisses both affirmative and negative: an
      announcement delivered too as the fulfilment of the purpose of
      Parmenides. Nothing is said at the end to intimate how the
      demonstrations are received by Sokrates, nor what lesson they are
      expected to administer to him: not a word of assent, or dissent,
      or surprise, or acknowledgment in any way, from the assembled
      company, though all of them had joined in entreating Parmenides,
      and had expressed the greatest anxiety to hear his dialectic
      exhibition. Those who think that an abrupt close, or an abrupt
      exordium, is sufficient reason for declaring a dialogue not to be
      the work of Plato (as Platonic critics often argue), are of course
      consistent in disallowing the Parmenides. For my part, I do not
      agree in the opinion. I take Plato as I find him, and I perceive
      both here and in the Protagoras and elsewhere, that he did not
      always think it incumbent upon him to adapt the end of his
      dialogues to the beginning. This may be called a defect, but I do
      not feel called upon to make out that Plato&#8217;s writings are free
      from defects; and to acknowledge nothing as his work unless I can
      show it to be faultless.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_27_35"></a>Different judgments of Platonic
        critics respecting the Antinomies and the dialogue generally.</span></p>
    <p>
      The demonstrations or Antinomies in the last half of the
      Parmenides are characterised by K. F. Hermann and others as a
      masterpiece of speculative acuteness. Yet if these same
      demonstrations, constructed with care and labour for the purpose
      of proving that the same premisses will conduct to double and
      contradictory conclusions, had come down to us from antiquity
      under the name either of the Megaric Eukleides, or Protagoras, or
      Gorgias &#8212; many of the Platonic critics would probably have <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page83" id="v3page83"></a>83</span>said
      of them (what is now said of the sceptical treatise remaining to
      us under the name of Gorgias) that they were poor productions
      worthy of such Sophists, who are declared to have made a trade of
      perverting truth. Certainly the conclusions of the demonstrations
      are specimens of that &#8220;Both and Neither,&#8221; which Plato (in the
      Euthydemus<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_49" href="#Footnotev3_27_49"><span
          class="sp">49</span></a>) puts into the mouth of the Sophist
      Dionysodorus as an answer of slashing defiance &#8212; and of that
      intentional evolution of contradictions which Plato occasionally
      discountenances, both in the Euthydemus and elsewhere.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_50" href="#Footnotev3_27_50"><span
          class="sp">50</span></a> And we know from Proklus<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_51" href="#Footnotev3_27_51"><span
          class="sp">51</span></a> that there were critics in ancient
      times, who depreciated various parts of the Parmenides as
      sophistical. Proklus himself denies the charge with some warmth.
      He as well as the principal Neo-Platonists between 200-530 <span
        class="smcap">A.D.</span> (especially his predecessors and
      instructors at Athens, Jamblichus, Syrianus, and Plutarchus)
      admired the Parmenides as a splendid effort of philosophical
      genius in its most exalted range, inspired so as to become
      cognizant of superhuman persons and agencies. They all agreed so
      far as to discover in the dialogue a sublime vein of mystic
      theology and symbolism: but along with this general agreement,
      there was much discrepancy in their interpretation of particular
      parts and passages. The commentary of Proklus attests the
      existence of such debates, reporting his own dissent from the
      interpretations sanctioned by his venerated masters, Plutarchus
      and Syrianus. That commentary, in spite of its prolixity, is
      curious to read as a specimen of the fifth century, <span
        class="smcap">A.D.</span>, in one of its most eminent
      representatives. Proklus discovers a string of theological symbols
      and a mystical meaning throughout the whole dialogue: not merely
      in the acute argumentation which characterises its middle part,
      but also in the perplexing antinomies of its close, and even in
      the dramatic <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page84"

        This commentary is annexed to Stallbaum&#8217;s edition of the
        Parmenides. Compare also the opinion of Marinus (disciple and
        biographer of Proklus) about the Parmenid&ecirc;s &#8212; Suidas v.
        &#924;&#945;&#961;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;. Jamblichus declared that Plato&#8217;s entire theory of
        philosophy was embodied in the two dialogues, Parmenides and
        Tim&aelig;us: in the Parmenides, all the intelligible or
        universal Entia were deduced from &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#957;: in the Tim&aelig;us,
        all cosmical realities were deduced from the Demiurgus. Proklus

      <p>
        Alkinous, in his Introduction to the Platonic Dialogues (c. 6,
        p. 159, in the Appendix Platonica attached to K. F. Hermann&#8217;s
        edition of Plato) quotes several examples of syllogistic
        reasoning from the Parmenides, and affirms that the ten
        categories of Aristotle are exhibited therein. </p>
      <p>
        Plotinus (Ennead. v. 1, 8) gives a brief summary of what he
        understood to be contained in the Antinomies of the Platonic
        Parmenides; but the interpretation departs widely from the
        original.</p>

        I transcribe a few sentences from the argument of Ficinus, to
        show what different meanings may be discovered in the same words
        by different critics. (Ficini Argum. in Plat. Parmen. p. 756.)

        Theologiam. Cumque in aliis longo intervallo c&aelig;teros
        philosophos antecesserit, in hoc tandem seipsum superasse
        videtur. Hic enim divus Plato de ipso Uno subtilissim&eacute;
        disputat: quemadmodum Ipsum Unum rerum omnium principium est,
        super omnia, omniaque ab illo: quo pacto ipsum extra omnia sit
        et in omnibus: omniaque ex illo, per illud, atque ad illud. Ad
        hujus, quod super essentiam est, Unius intelligentiam gradatim
        ascendit. In iis qu&aelig; fluunt et sensibus subjiciuntur et
        sensibilia nominantur: In iis etiam quas semper eadem sunt et
        sensibilia nuncupantur, non sensibus amplius sed sol&acirc;
        mente percipienda: Nec in iis tantum, verum etiam supra sensum
        et sensibilia, intellectumque et intelligibilia:&#8212; ipsum Unum
        existit. &#8212; Illud insuper advertendum est, quod in hoc dialogo
        cum dicitur <i>Unum</i>, Pythagoreorum more qu&aelig;que
        substantia a materi&acirc; penitus absoluta significari potest:
        ut Deus, Mens, Anima. Cum vero dicitur Aliud et Alia, tam
        materia, quam illa qu&aelig; in materi&acirc; fiunt, intelligere
        licet.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The Prolegomena, prefixed by Thomson to his edition of the
        Parmenides, interpret the dialogue in the same general way as
        Proklus and Ficinus: they suppose that by Unum is understood
        Summus Deus, and they discover in the concluding Antinomies
        theological demonstrations of the unity, simplicity, and other
        attributes of God. Thomson observes, very justly, that the
        Parmenides is one of the most difficult dialogues in Plato
        (Prolegom. iv.-x.) But in my judgment, his mode of exposition,
        far from smoothing the difficulties, adds new ones greater than
        those in the text.</p>

      Proklus (followed by Ficinus in the fifteenth century), who extols

      religious truths &#8212; and those of the modern Tiedemann, who despises
      them as foolish subtleties and cannot read them with patience &#8212; is
      quite sufficient to inspire a reasonable Platonic critic with
      genuine diffidence.</p>

    <p>
      In so far as these different expositions profess, each in its own
      way, to detect a positive dogmatical result or purpose in the
      Parmenides,<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_54" href="#Footnotev3_27_54"><span
          class="sp">54</span></a> none of them carry conviction to my

        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page86" id="v3page86"></a>86</span>which
      we read in Proklus. If Plato had any such purpose, he makes no
      intimation of it, directly or indirectly. On the contrary, he
      announces another purpose not only different, but contrary. The
      veteran Parmenides, while praising the ardour of speculative
      research displayed by Sokrates, at the same time reproves gently,
      but distinctly, the confident forwardness of two such immature
      youths as Sokrates and Aristotle in laying down positive doctrines
      without the preliminary exercise indispensable for testing them.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_55" href="#Footnotev3_27_55"><span
          class="sp">55</span></a> Parmenides appears from the beginning
      to the end of the dialogue as a propounder of doubts and
      objections, not as a doctrinal teacher. He seeks to restrain the
      haste of Sokrates &#8212; to make him ashamed of premature affirmation<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page87" id="v3page87"></a>87</span>
      and the false persuasion of knowledge &#8212; to force upon him a keen
      sense of real difficulties which have escaped his notice. To this
      end, a specimen is given of the exercise required. It is certainly
      well calculated to produce the effect intended &#8212; of hampering,
      perplexing, and putting to shame, the affirmative rashness of a
      novice in philosophy. It exhibits a tangled skein of ingenious
      contradiction which the novice must somehow bring into order,
      before he is in condition to proclaim any positive dogma. If it
      answers this purpose, it does all that Parmenides promises.
      Sokrates is warned against attaching himself exclusively to one
      side of an hypothesis, and neglecting the opposite: against
      surrendering himself to some pre-conception, traditional, or
      self-originated, and familiarising his mind with its consequences,
      while no pains are taken to study the consequences of the negative
      side, and bring them into comparison. It is this one-sided mental
      activity, and premature finality of assertion, which Parmenides
      seeks to correct. Whether the corrective exercises which he
      prescribes are the best for the purpose, may be contested: but
      assuredly the malady which he seeks to correct is deeply rooted in
      our human nature, and is combated by Sokrates himself, though by
      other means, in several of the Platonic dialogues. It is a rare
      mental endowment to study both sides of a question, and suspend
      decision until the consequences of each are fully known.</p>

        I agree with Schleiermacher, in considering that the purpose of
        the Parmenides is nothing beyond &#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;, or exercise in the
        method and perplexities of philosophising (Einl. p. 83): but I
        do not agree with him, when he says (pp. 90-105) that the
        objections urged by Parmenides (in the middle of the dialogue)
        against the separate substantiality of Forms or Ideas, though
        noway answered in the dialogue itself, are sufficiently answered
        in other dialogues (which he considers later in time),
        especially in the Sophistes (though, according to Brandis,
        Handb. Gr.-R&ouml;m. Phil. p. 241, the Sophistes is earlier than
        the Parmenides). Zeller, on the other hand, denies that these
        objections are at all answered in the Sophistes; but he
        maintains that the second part of the Parmenides itself clears
        up the difficulties propounded in the first part. After an
        elaborate analysis (in the Platon. Studien, pp. 168-178) of the
        Antinomies or contradictory Demonstrations in the concluding
        part of the dialogue, Zeller affirms the purpose of them to be
        &#8220;die richtige Ansicht von den Ideen als der Einheit in dem
        Mannichfaltigen der Erscheinung dialektisch zu begr&uuml;nden,
        die Ideenlehre m&ouml;glichen Einw&uuml;rfen und
        Missverst&auml;ndnissen gegen&uuml;ber dialektisch zu
        begr&uuml;nden&#8221; (pp. 180-182). This solution has found favour
        with some subsequent commentators. See Susemihl, Die genetische
        Entwickelung der Platon. Philosophie, pp. 341-353; Heinrich
        Stein, Vorgeschichte und System des Platonismus, pp. 217-220.</p>
      <p>
        To me it appears (what Zeller himself remarks in p. 188, upon
        the discovery of Schleiermacher that the objections started in
        the Parmenides are answered in the Sophistes) that it requires
        all the acuteness of so able a writer as Zeller to detect any
        such result as that which he here extracts from the Parmenidean
        Antinomies &#8212; from what Aristeides calls (Or. xlvii. p. 430) &#8220;the
        One and Many, the multiplied twists and doublings, of this
        divine dialogue&#8221;. I confess that I am unable to perceive therein
        what Zeller has either found or elicited. Objections and
        misunderstandings (Einw&uuml;rfe und Missverst&auml;ndnisse),
        far from being obviated or corrected, are accumulated from the
        beginning to the end of these Antinomies, and are summed up in a
        formidable total by the final sentence of the dialogue.
        Moreover, none of these objections which Parmenides had advanced
        in the earlier part of the dialogue are at all noticed, much
        less answered, in the concluding Antinomies.</p>
      <p>
        The general view taken by Zeller of the Platonic Parmenides, is
        repeated by him in his Phil. der Griech. vol. ii. pp.
        394-415-429, ed. 2nd. In the first place, I do not think that he
        sets forth exactly (see p. 415) the reasoning as we read it in
        Plato; but even if that were exactly set forth, still what we
        read in Plato is nothing but an assemblage of difficulties and
        contradictions. These are indeed suggestive, and such as a
        profound critic may meditate with care, until he finds himself
        put upon a train of thought conducting him to conclusions sound
        and tenable in his judgment. But the explanations, sufficient or
        not, belong after all not to Plato but to the critic himself.
        Other critics may attach, and have attached, totally different
        explanations to the same difficulties. I see no adequate
        evidence to bring home any one of them to Plato; or to prove
        (what is the main point to be determined) that any one of them
        was present to his mind when he composed the dialogue. </p>
      <p>
        Schwegler also gives an account of what he affirms to be the
        purpose and meaning of the Parmenides &#8212; &#8220;The positive meaning of
        the antinomies contained in it can only be obtained by
        inferences which Plato does not himself expressly enunciate, but
        leaves to the reader to draw&#8221; (Geschichte der Philosophie im
        Umriss, sect. 14, 4 c. pp. 52-53, ed. 5). </p>
      <p>
        A learned man like Schwegler, who both knows the views of other
        philosophers, and has himself reflected on philosophy, may
        perhaps find affirmative meaning in the Parmenides; just as
        Sokrates, in the Platonic Protagoras, finds his own ethical
        doctrine in the song of the poet Simonides. But I venture to say
        that no contemporary reader of Plato could have found such a
        meaning in the Parmenides; and that if Plato intended to
        communicate such a meaning, the whole structure of the dialogue
        would be only an elaborate puzzle calculated to prevent nearly
        all readers from reaching it.</p>
      <p>
        By assigning the leadership of the dialogue to Parmenides
        (Schwegler says) Plato intends to signify that the Platonic
        doctrine of Ideas is coincident with the doctrine of Parmenides,
        and is only a farther development thereof. How can this be
        signified, when the discourse assigned to Parmenides consists of
        a string of objections against the doctrine of Ideas, concluding
        with an intimation that there are other objections, yet
        stronger, remaining behind?</p>
      <p>
        The fundamental thought of the Parmenides (says Schwegler) is,
        that the One is not conceivable in complete abstraction from the
        Many, nor the Many in complete abstraction from the One, &#8212; that
        each reciprocally supposes and serves as condition to the other.
        Not so: for if we follow the argumentation of Parmenides (p. 131
        E), we shall see that what he principally insists upon, is the
        entire impossibility of any connection or participation between
        the One and the Many &#8212; there is an impassable gulf between them.</p>
      <p>
        Is the discussion of &#964;&#8056; &#7955;&#957; (in the closing Antinomies) intended
        as an example of dialectic investigation &#8212; or is it <i>per se</i>
        the special object of the dialogue? This last is clearly the
        truth (says Schwegler). &#8220;otherwise the dialogue would end
        without result, and its two portions would be without any
        internal connection&#8221;. Not so; for if we read the dialogue, we
        find Parmenides clearly proclaiming and singling out &#964;&#8056; &#7955;&#957; as
        only one among a great many different notions, each of which
        must be made the subject of a bilateral hypothesis, to be
        followed out into its consequences on both sides (p. 136 A).
        Moreover, I think that the &#8220;internal connection&#8221; between the
        first and the last half of the dialogue, consists in the
        application of this dialectic method, and in nothing else. If
        the dialogue ends without result, this is true of many other
        Platonic dialogues. The student is brought face to face with
        logical difficulties, and has to find out the solution for
        himself; or perhaps to find out that no solution can be
        obtained.</p>

    <p>
      Such, in my judgment, is the drift of the contradictory
      demonstrations here put into the mouth of Parmenides respecting
      Unum and C&aelig;tera. Thus far at least, we are perfectly safe:
      for we are conforming strictly to the language of Plato himself in
      the dialogue: we have no proof that he meant anything more. Those
      who presume that he must have had some ulterior dogmatical
      purpose, place themselves upon hypothetical ground: but when they
      go farther and attempt to set forth what this purpose was, they
      show their ingenuity only by bringing out what they themselves
      have dropped in. The number of discordant hypotheses attests<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_56" href="#Footnotev3_27_56"><span
          class="sp">56</span></a> the difficulty of the problem. I
      agree with those <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page88"
          id="v3page88"></a>88</span>early Platonic commentators
      (mentioned and opposed by Proklus) who could see no other purpose
      in these demonstrations than that of dialectical exercise. In this
      view Schleiermacher, Ast, Str&uuml;mpell, and others mainly
      concur: the two former however annexing to it a farther hypothesis
      &#8212; which I think improbable &#8212; that the dialogue has come to us
      incomplete; having once contained at the end (or having been
      originally destined to contain, though the intention may never
      have been realised) an appendix elucidating the perplexities of
      the demonstrations.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_57"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> This
      would have been inconsistent with the purpose declared by
      Parmenides: who, far from desiring to facilitate the onward march
      of Sokrates by clearing up difficulties, admonishes him that he is
      advancing too rapidly, and seeks to keep him back by giving him a
      heap of manifest contradictions to disentangle. Plato conceives
      the training for philosophy or for the highest exercise of
      intellectual force, to be not less laborious than that which was
      required for the bodily perfections of an Olympic athlete. The
      student must not be helped out of difficulties at once: he must
      work his own way slowly out of them.</p>

        then proceeds to state what Plato&#8217;s ulterior purpose was, but in
        such very vague language, that I hardly understand what he
        means, much less can I find it in the Antinomies themselves. He
        has some clearer language, p. 241, where he treats these

        I do not agree with Socher&#8217;s conclusion, that the Parmenides is
        not a Platonic composition. But I think he is quite right in
        saying that the dialogue as it now stands performs all that
        Parmenides promises, and leaves no ground for contending that it
        is an unfinished fragment (Socher, Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, p.
        286), so far as philosophical speculation is concerned. The
        dialogue as a dramatic or literary composition undoubtedly lacks
        a proper close; it is &#7940;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#962; or &#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#946;&#8056;&#962; (Aristot. Rhetor. iii.

    <p>
      That the demonstrations include assumption both unwarranted and
      contradictory, mingled with sophistical subtlety (in the modern
      sense of the words), is admitted by most of the commentators: and
      I think that the real <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page89"
          id="v3page89"></a>89</span>amount of it is greater than they
      admit. How far Plato was himself aware of this, I will not
      undertake to say. Perhaps he was not. The reasonings which have
      passed for sublime and profound in the estimation of so many
      readers, may well have appeared the same to their author. I have
      already remarked that Plato&#8217;s ratiocinative force is much greater
      on the negative side than on the positive: more ingenious in
      suggesting logical difficulties than sagacious in solving them.
      Impressed, as Sokrates had been before him, with the duty of
      combating the false persuasion of knowledge, or premature and
      untested belief, &#8212; he undertook to set forth the pleadings of
      negation in the most forcible manner. Many of his dialogues
      manifest this tendency, but the Parmenides more than any other.
      That dialogue is a collection of unexplained &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953; (such as
      those enumerated in the second book of Aristotle&#8217;s Metaphysica)
      brought against a doctrine which yet Plato declares to be the
      indispensable condition of all reasoning. It concludes with a
      string of demonstrations by which contradictory conclusions (Both
      and Neither) are successively proved, and which appear like a <i>reductio
        ad absurdum</i> of all demonstration. But at the time when Plato
      composed the dialogue, I think it not improbable that these
      difficulties and contradictions appeared even to himself
      unanswerable: in other words, that he did not himself see any
      answers and explanations of them. He had tied a knot so
      complicated, that he could not himself untie it. I speak of the
      state of Plato&#8217;s mind when he wrote the Parmenides. At the dates
      of other dialogues (whether earlier or later), he wrote under
      different points of view; but no key to the Parmenides does he
      ever furnish.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_39"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_39"></a>Even if Plato himself saw through
        these subtleties, he might still choose to impose and to heap up
        difficulties in the way of a forward affirmative aspirant.</span></p>
    <p>
      If however we suppose that Plato must have had the key present to
      his own mind, he might still think it right to employ, in such a
      dialogue, reasonings recognised by himself as defective. It is the
      task imposed upon Sokrates to find out and expose these defective
      links. There is no better way of illustrating how universal is the
      malady of human intelligence &#8212; unexamined belief and
      over-confident affirmation &#8212; as it stands proclaimed to be in the
      Platonic Apology. Sokrates is exhibited in the Parmenides as
      placed under the screw of the Elenchus, and no more able than
      others <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page90" id="v3page90"></a>90</span>to
      extricate himself from it, when it is applied by Parmenides:
      though he bears up successfully against Zeno, and attracts to
      himself respectful compliments, even from the aged dialectician
      who tests him. After the Elenchus applied to himself, Sokrates
      receives a farther lesson from the &#8220;Neither and Both&#8221;
      demonstrations addressed by Parmenides to the still younger
      Aristotle. Sokrates will thus be driven, with his indefatigable
      ardour for speculative research, to work at the problem &#8212; to
      devote to it those seasons of concentrated meditation, which
      sometimes exhibited him fixed for hours in the same place and
      almost in the same attitude<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_58"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> &#8212; until
      he can extricate himself from such difficulties and
      contradictions. But that he shall not extricate himself without
      arduous mental effort, is the express intention of Parmenides:
      just as the Xenophontic Sokrates proceeds with the youthful
      Euthydemus and the Platonic Sokrates with Lysis, The&aelig;tetus,
      and others. Plausible subtlety was not unsuitable for such a
      lesson.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_59" href="#Footnotev3_27_59"><span
          class="sp">59</span></a> Moreover, in the Parmenides, Plato
      proclaims explicitly that the essential condition of the lesson is
      to be strictly private: that a process so roundabout and tortuous
      cannot be appreciated by ordinary persons, and would be unseemly
      before an audience.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_60"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> He
      selects as respondent the youngest person in the company, one
      still younger than Sokrates: because (he says) such a person will
      reply with artless simplicity, to each question as the question
      may strike him &#8212; not carrying his mind forward to the ulterior
      questions for which his reply may furnish the handle &#8212; not afraid
      of being entangled in puzzling inconsistencies &#8212; not solicitous to
      baffle the purpose of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page91"

        Plato, Parmenid. pp. 136 C, 137 A. Hobbes remarks (Computatio

        will be thought both ridiculous and absurd, for a man to use
        such language publicly&#8221;.</p>

        enjoined by the Platonic Parmenides is so prodigious, that no
        one after Plato employed it (Prokl. ad Parmenid. p. 306, p. 801,

      <p>
        To understand the force of this remark of Parmenides, we should
        contrast it with the precepts given by Aristotle in the Topica
        for dialectic debate: precepts teaching the questioner how to
        puzzle, and the respondent how to avoid being puzzled. Such
        precautions are advised to the respondent by Aristotle, not
        merely in the Topica but also in the Analytica &#8212; &#967;&#961;&#8052; &#948;&#8217; &#8005;&#960;&#949;&#961;

          id="Sidenotev3_27_40"></a>The exercises exhibited by
        Parmenides are exhibited only as illustrative specimens of a
        method enjoined to be applied to many other Antinomies.</span></p>
    <p>
      We must remark farther, that the two hypotheses here handled at
      length by Parmenides are presented by him only as examples of a
      dialectical process which he enjoins the lover of truth to apply
      equally to many other hypotheses.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_62"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> As he
      shows that in the case of Unum, each of the two assumptions (Unum
      est &#8212; Unum non est) can be traced through different threads of
      deductive reasoning so as to bring out double and contradictory
      results &#8212; Both and Neither: so also in the case of those other
      assumptions which remain to be tested afterwards in like manner,
      antinomies of the same character may be expected: antinomies
      apparent at least, if not real &#8212; which must be formally propounded
      and dealt with, before we can trust ourselves as having attained
      reasoned truth. Hence we see that, negative and puzzling as the
      dialogue called Parmenides is, even now &#8212; it would be far more
      puzzling if all that it prescribes in general terms had been
      executed in detail. While it holds out, in the face of an aspirant
      in philosophy, the necessity of giving equal presumptive value to
      the affirmative and negative sides of each hypothesis, and
      deducing with equal care, the consequences of both &#8212; it warns him
      at the same time of the contradictions in which he will thereby
      become involved. These contradictions are presented in the most
      glaring manner: but we must recollect a striking passage in the
      Republic, where Plato declares that to confront the aspirant with
      manifest contradictions, is the best way of provoking him to
      intellectual effort in the higher regions of speculation.<a

      I have already had occasion, when I touched upon the other <i>viri

      contemporaneous with or subsequent to Plato, to give some account
      of the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_2_12">Zenonian</a> and <a
        href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_3_13">Megaric</a> dialecticians,
      and of their sophisms or logical puzzles, which attracted so much
      attention from speculative men, in the fourth and third centuries
      <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> These Megarics, like the Sophists,
      generally receive very harsh epithets from the historian of
      philosophy. They took the negative side, impugned affirmative
      dogmas, insisted on doubts and difficulties, and started problems
      troublesome to solve. I have tried to show, that such disputants,
      far from deserving all the censure which has been poured upon
      them, presented one indispensable condition to the formation of
      any tolerable logical theory.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_64"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> Their
      sophisms were challenges to the logician, indicating various forms
      of error and confusion, against which a theory of reasoning, in
      order to be sufficient, was required to guard. And the
      demonstrations given by Plato in the latter half of the Parmenides
      are challenges of the same kind: only more ingenious, elaborate,
      and effective, than any of those (so far as we know them) proposed
      by the Megarics &#8212; by Zeno, or Eukleides, or Diodorus Kronus. The
      Platonic Parmenides here shows, that in regard to a particular
      question, those who believe the affirmative, those who believe the
      negative, and those who believe neither &#8212; can all furnish good
      reasons for their respective conclusions. In each case he gives
      the proof confidently as being good: and whether unimpeachable or
      not, it is certainly very ingenious and subtle. Such
      demonstrations are in the spirit of Sextus Empiricus, who rests
      his theory of scepticism upon the general fact, that there are
      opposite and contradictory conclusions, both of them supported by
      evidence equally good: the affirmative no more worthy of belief
      than the negative.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_65"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> Zeno
      (or, as Plato calls him, the Eleatic <span class="pagenum"><a

        name="FnAnchorv3_27_66" href="#Footnotev3_27_66"><span
          class="sp">66</span></a>) did not profess any systematic
      theory of scepticism; but he could prove by ingenious and varied
      dialectic, both the thesis and the antithesis on several points of
      philosophy, by reasons which few, if any, among his hearers could
      answer. In like manner the Platonic Parmenides enunciates his
      contradictory demonstrations as real logical problems, which must
      exercise the sagacity and hold back the forward impulse of an
      eager philosophical aspirant. Even if this dilemma respecting Unum
      Est and Unum non Est, be solved, Parmenides intimates that he has
      others in reserve: so that either no tenable positive result will
      ever be attained &#8212; or at least it will not be attained until after
      such an amount of sagacity and patient exercise as Sokrates
      himself declares to be hardly practicable.<a

        Among the commentators on the Categories of Aristotle, there
        were several whose principal object it was to propound all the
        most grave and troublesome difficulties which they could think
        of. Simplikius does not commend the style of these men, but he
        expresses his gratitude to them for the pains which they had
        taken in the exposition of the negative case, and for the
        stimulus and opportunity which they had thus administered to the
        work of affirmative exposition (Simplikius, Schol. ad Categ.
        Aristot. p. 40, a. 22-30; Schol. Brandis). David the Armenian,
        in his Scholia on the Categories (p. 27, b. 41, Brandis),

        Indeed, the second demonstration, among the nine given by
        Parmenides (pp. 143 A, 155 C), coincides to a great degree with
        the conclusion which Zeno is represented as having maintained in
        his published dissertation (p. 127 E); and shows that the
        difficulties and contradictions belong to the world of invisible
        Ideas, as well as to that of sensible particulars, which
        Sokrates had called in question (p. 129 C-E).</p>
      <p>
        The Aristotelian treatise (whether by Aristotle, Theophrastus,
        or any other author) De Zenone, Melisso, Xenophane, et
        Gorgi&acirc; &#8212; affords some curious comparisons with the
        Parmenides of Plato. Aristotel. p. 974 seq. Bekk.; also

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_43"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_43"></a>Assumptions of Parmenides in his
        Demonstrations convey the minimum of determinate meaning. Views
        of Aristotle upon these indeterminate predicates, Ens, Unum,
        &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>
      It may indeed be useful for the critic to perform for himself the
      process which Parmenides intended Sokrates to perform; and to
      analyse these subtleties with a view to measure their bearing upon
      the work of dogmatic theorising. We see double and contradictory
      conclusions elicited, in four separate Antinomies, from the same
      hypothesis, by distinct chains of interrogatory deduction; each
      question being sufficiently plausible to obtain the acquiescence
      of the respondent. The two assumptions successively laid down by
      Parmenides as <i>principia</i> for deduction &#8212; <i>Si Unum est</i>
      &#8212; <i>Si Unum non est</i> &#8212; convey the very minimum of determinate
      meaning. Indeed both words are essentially indeterminate. Both
      Unum and Ens are declared by Aristotle to be not univocal or
      generic words,<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_71" href="#Footnotev3_27_71"><span
          class="sp">71</span></a> though at the same time not
      absolutely equivocal: but words bearing several distinct
      transitional<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page95" id="v3page95"></a>95</span>
      meanings, derived either from each other, or from some common
      root, by an analogy more or less remote. Aristotle characterises
      in like manner all the most indeterminate predicates, which are
      not included in any one distinct category among the ten, but are
      made available to predication sometimes in one category, sometimes
      in another: such as Ens, Unum, Idem, Diversum, Contrarium, &amp;c.
      Now in the Platonic Parmenides, the two first among these words
      are taken to form the proposition assumed as fundamental datum,
      and the remaining three are much employed in the demonstration:
      yet Plato neither notices nor discriminates their multifarious and
      fluctuating significations. Such contrast will be understood when
      we recollect that the purpose of the Platonic Parmenides is, to
      propound difficulties; while that of Aristotle is, not merely to
      propound, but also to assist in clearing them up.</p>

        Simplikius noted it as one among the differences between Plato
        and Aristotle &#8212; That Plato admitted Unum as having only one
        meaning, not being aware of the diversity of meanings which it
        bore; while Aristotle expressly pointed it out as a &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8182;&#962;
        &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; (Schol. ad Aristot. Sophist. Elench. p. 320, b. 3,
        Brandis). Aristotle farther remarks that Plato considered &#964;&#8056;
        &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; as &#7955;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8183;, and that this was an error; we ought rather
        to say that Plato did not clearly discriminate &#7955;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8183; from &#7955;&#957;
        &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#949;&#953; (Aristot. Topic. vi. 143, b. 30).</p>
      <p>
        Simplikius farther remarks, that it was Aristotle who first
        rendered to Logic the important service of bringing out clearly
        and emphatically the idea of &#964;&#8056; &#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#8212; the same word with
        several meanings either totally distinct and disparate, or
        ramifying in different directions from the same root, so that
        there came to be little or no affinity between many of them. It
        was Aristotle who first classified and named these distinctions
        (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#8212; &#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957;, and the intermediate &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8217; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#957;),
        though they had been partially noticed by Plato and even by
        Sokrates. &#7957;&#969;&#962; &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#959;&#8016; &#960;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#957; &#7956;&#954;&#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7974;&#957; &#964;&#8056;

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_44"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_44"></a>In the Platonic Demonstrations the
        same proposition in words is made to bear very different
        meanings.</span></p>
    <p>
      Certainly, in Demonstrations 1 and 2 (as well as 4 and 5), the
      foundation assumed is in words the same proposition &#8212; <i>Si Unum
        est</i>: but we shall find this same proposition used in two
      very different senses. In the first Demonstration, the proposition
      is equivalent to <i>Si Unum est Unum</i>:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_72" href="#Footnotev3_27_72"><span
          class="sp">72</span></a> in the second, to <i>Si Unum est Ens</i>,
      or <i>Si Unum existit</i>. In the first the proposition is
      identical and the verb <i>est</i> serves only as copula: in the
      second, the verb <i>est</i> is not merely a copula but implies
      Ens as a predicate, and affirms existence. We might have imagined
      that the identical proposition &#8212; <i>Unum est Unum</i> &#8212; since it
      really affirms nothing &#8212; would have been barren of all
      consequences: and so indeed it is barren of all affirmative
      consequences. But Plato obtains for it one first step in the way
      of negative predicates &#8212; <i>Si Unum est Unum, Unum non est Multa</i>:
      and from hence he proceeds, by a series of gentle transitions
      ingeniously managed, to many other negative predications
      respecting the subject <i>Unum</i>. Since it is not Multa, it can
      have no parts, nor can it be a whole: it has neither beginning,
      middle, nor end: it has no boundary, or it is boundless: it has no
      figure, it is neither straight nor circular: it has therefore no
      place, being <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page96"
          id="v3page96"></a>96</span>neither in itself, nor in anything
      else: it is neither in motion nor at rest: it is neither the same
      with anything else, nor the same with itself:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_73" href="#Footnotev3_27_73"><span
          class="sp">73</span></a> it is neither different from any
      thing else, nor different from itself: it is neither like, nor
      unlike, to itself, nor to anything else: it is neither equal, nor
      unequal, to itself nor to any thing else: it is neither older nor
      younger, nor of equal age, either with itself or with anything
      else: it exists therefore not in time, nor has it any
      participation with time: it neither has been nor will be, nor is:
      it does not exist in any way: it does not even exist so as to be
      Unum: you can neither name it, nor reason upon it, nor know it,
      nor perceive it, nor opine about it.</p>

      showing that everything can be denied, and that nothing can be
      affirmed of the subject &#8212; Unum. All this follows, if you concede
      the first step, that Unum is not Multa. If Unum be said to have
      any other attribute except that of being Unum, it would become at
      once Multa. It cannot even be declared to be either the same with
      itself, or different from any thing else; because Idem and
      Diversum are distinct natures from Unum, and if added to it would
      convert it into Multa.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_75"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> Nay it
      cannot even be affirmed to be itself: it cannot be named or
      enunciated: if all predicates are denied, the subject is denied
      along with them: the subject is nothing but the sum total of its
      predicates &#8212; and when they are all withdrawn, no subject remains.
      As far as I can understand the bearing of this self-contradictory
      demonstration, it appears a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the
      proposition &#8212; <i>Unum is not Multa</i>. Now <i>Unum which is not
        Multa</i> designates the &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;-&#7963;&#957; or Unum Ideale; which Plato
      himself affirmed, and which Aristotle impugned.<a

        and the observations which Plato makes in the Phil&ecirc;bus
        upon &#7963;&#957; and &#928;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;. Would he mean to include the demonstrations
        which we read in the Parmenides, in the category of what he
        calls in Phil&ecirc;bus &#8220;childish, easy, and irrational debates
        on that vexed question?&#8221; (Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 14 D).
        Hardly: for they are at any rate most elaborate as well as
        ingenious and suggestive. Yet neither do they suit the
        description which he gives in Phil&ecirc;bus of the genuine,
        serious, and difficult debates on the same question.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_46"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_46"></a>Second Demonstration.</span></p>
    <p>
      Parmenides now proceeds to his second demonstration: professing to
      take up again the same hypothesis &#8212; <i>Si Unum est</i> &#8212; from
      which he had started in the first<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_77"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> &#8212; but in
      reality taking up a different hypothesis under the same words. In
      the first hypothesis, <i>Si Unum est</i>, was equivalent to, <i>Si
        Unum est Unum</i>: nothing besides <i>Unum</i> being taken into
      the reasoning, and <i>est</i> serving merely as copula. In the
      second, <i>Si Unum est</i>, is equivalent to, <i>Si Unum est Ens</i>,
      or exists: so that instead of the isolated <i>Unum</i>, we have
      now <i>Unum Ens</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_78"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> Here is
      a duality consisting of <i>Unum and Ens</i>: which two are
      considered as separate or separable factors, coalescing to form
      the whole <i>Unum Ens</i>, each of them being a part thereof. But
      each of these parts is again dual, containing both <i>Unum and
        Ens</i>: so that each part may be again divided into lesser
      parts, each of them alike dual: and so on ad infinitum. <i>Unum
        Ens</i> thus contains an infinite number of parts, or is <i>Multa</i>.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_79" href="#Footnotev3_27_79"><span
          class="sp">79</span></a> But even <i>Unum</i> <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page98" id="v3page98"></a>98</span>itself
      (Parmenides argues), if we consider it separately from <i>Ens</i>
      in which it participates, is not <i>Unum</i> alone, but <i>Multa</i>
      also. For it is different from <i>Ens</i>, and <i>Ens</i> is
      different from it. <i>Unum</i> therefore is not merely <i>Unum</i>
      but also <i>Diversum</i>: <i>Ens</i> also is not merely <i>Ens</i>
      but <i>Diversum</i>. Now when we speak of <i>Unum</i> and <i>Ens</i>
      &#8212; of <i>Unum</i> and <i>Diversum</i> &#8212; or of <i>Ens</i> and <i>Diversum</i>
      &#8212; we in each case speak of two distinct things, each of which is <i>Unum</i>.
      Since each is <i>Unum</i>, the two things become three &#8212; <i>Ens</i>,
      <i>Diversum</i>, <i>Unum</i> &#8212; <i>Unum</i>, <i>Diversum</i>, <i>Unum</i>
      &#8212; <i>Unum</i> being here taken twice. We thus arrive at two and
      three &#8212; twice and thrice &#8212; odd and even &#8212; in short, number, with
      its full extension and properties. Unum therefore is both Unum and
      Multa &#8212; both Totum and Partes &#8212; both finite and infinite in
      multitude.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_80" href="#Footnotev3_27_80"><span

        Plato, Parmenid. pp. 142-143. This is exactly what Sokrates in
        the early part of the dialogue (p. 129 B-D) had pronounced to be
        utterly inadmissible, <i>viz.</i>: That &#8003; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7955;&#957; should be
        &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#8212; that &#8003; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8005;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#957; should be &#7936;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#957;. The essential
        characteristic of the Platonic Ideas is here denied. However, it
        appears to me that Plato here reasons upon two contradictory
        assumptions; first, that <i>Unum Ens</i> is a total composed of
        two parts separately assignable &#8212; <i>Unum</i> and <i>Ens</i>;
        next, that <i>Unum</i> is not assignable separately from <i>Ens</i>,
        nor <i>Ens</i> from <i>Unum</i>. Proceeding upon the first, he
        declares that the division must be carried on ad infinitum,
        because you can never reach either the separate <i>Ens</i> or
        the separate <i>Unum</i>. But these two assumptions cannot be
        admitted both together. Plato must make his election; either he
        takes the first, in which case the total Unum Ens is divisible,
        and its two factors, Unum and Ens, can be assigned separately;
        or he takes the second, in which case <i>Unum</i> and <i>Ens</i>
        cannot be assigned separately &#8212; are not distinguishable factors, &#8212;
        so that <i>Unum Ens</i> instead of being infinitely divisible,
        is not divisible at all. </p>
      <p>
        The reasoning as it now stands is, in my judgment, fallacious.</p>

      Parmenides finishes the long Demonstratio Secunda, which completes
      the first Antinomy. The last conclusion of all, with which it
      winds up, is the antithesis of that with which the first
      Demonstration wound up: affirming (what the conclusion of the
      first had denied) that Unum is thinkable, perceivable, nameable,
      knowable. Comparing the second Demonstration with the first, we
      see &#8212; That the first, taking its initial step, with a negative
      proposition, carries us through a series of conclusions every one
      of which is negative (like those of the second figure of the
      Aristotelian syllogism):&#8212; That whereas the conclusions professedly
      established in the first Demonstration are all in <i>Neither</i>
      (Unum is neither in itself nor in any thing else &#8212; neither at rest
      nor in motion &#8212; neither the same with itself nor different from
      itself, &amp;c.), the conclusions of the second Demonstration are
      all in <i>Both</i> (Unum is both in motion and at rest, both in
      itself and in other things, both the same with itself and
      different from itself):&#8212; That in this manner, while the first
      Demonstration denies both of two opposite propositions, the second
      affirms them both.</p>

    <p>
      Such a result has an air of startling paradox. We find it shown,
      respecting various pairs of contradictory propositions, first,
      that both are false &#8212; next, that both are true. This offends
      doubly against the logical canon, which declares, that of two
      contradictory propositions, one must be true, the other must be
      false. We must remember, that in the Platonic age, there existed
      no systematic logic &#8212; no analysis or classification of
      propositions &#8212; no recognised distinction between such as were
      contrary, and such as were contradictory. The Platonic Parmenides
      deals with propositions which are, to appearance at least,

        Prantl (in his Geschichte der Logik, vol. i. s. 3, pp. 70-71-73)
        maintains, if I rightly understand him, not only that Plato did
        not adopt the <i>principium identitatis et contradictionis</i>
        as the basis of his reasonings, but that one of Plato&#8217;s express
        objects was to demonstrate the contrary of it, partly in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus, but especially in the Parmenides:&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Eine arge T&auml;uschung ist es, zu glauben, dass das
        principium identitatis et contradictionis oberstes logisches
        Princip des Plato sei &#8230; Es ist gerade eine Hauptaufgabe, welche
        sich Plato stellen musste, die Coexistenz der Gegens&auml;tze
        nachzuweisen, wie diess bekanntlich im Philebus und <i>besonders
          im Parmenides</i> geschieht.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        According to this view, the Antinomies in the Parmenides are all
        of them good proofs, and the conclusions of all of them, summed
        up as they are in the final sentence of the dialogue, constitute
        an addition to the positive knowledge of Sokrates. I confess
        that this to me is unintelligible. I understand these Antinomies
        as &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953; to be cleared up, but in no other character.</p>
      <p>
        Prantl speaks (p. 73) of &#8220;die antinomische Begr&uuml;ndung der
        Ideenlehre im Parmenides,&#8221; &amp;c. This is the same language as
        that used by Zeller, upon which I have already remarked.</p>

      How can this be possible? How can these four propositions all be
      true &#8212; <i>Unum est Unum</i> &#8212; <i>Unum est Multa</i> &#8212; <i>Unum
        non est Unum</i> &#8212; <i>Unum non est Multa</i>? Plato suggests a
      way out of the difficulty, in that which he gives as Demonstration
      3. It has been shown that Unum &#8220;partakes of time&#8221; &#8212; was, is, and
      will be. The propositions are all true, but true at different
      times: one at this time, another at that time.<a

      alternately like and unlike, in motion and at rest. But how is
      such alternation or change intelligible? At each time, whether
      present or past, it must be either in motion or at rest: at no
      time, neither present nor past, can it be <i>neither</i> in
      motion <i>nor</i> at rest. It cannot, while in motion, change to
      rest &#8212; nor, while at rest, change to motion. No time can be
      assigned for the change: neither the present, nor the past, nor
      the future: how then can the change occur at all?<a

        This is a distinction analogous to that which Plato points out

        Instantaneous &#8212; Breaches or momentary stoppages in the course of
        time.</span></p>
    <p>
      To this question the Platonic Parmenides finds an answer in what
      he calls the <i>Sudden</i> or the <i>Instantaneous</i>: an
      anomalous nature which lies out of, or apart from, the course of
      time, being neither past, present, nor future. That which changes,
      changes at once and suddenly: at an instant when it is neither in
      motion nor at rest. This <i>Suddenly</i> is a halt or break in
      the flow of time:<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_92"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> an
      extra-temporal condition, in which the subject has <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page101" id="v3page101"></a>101</span>no
      existence, no attributes &#8212; though it revives again forthwith
      clothed with its new attributes: a point of total negation or
      annihilation, during which the subject with all its attributes
      disappears. At this interval (the <i>Suddenly</i>) all predicates
      may be truly denied, but none can be truly affirmed.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_93" href="#Footnotev3_27_93"><span
          class="sp">93</span></a> Unum is neither at rest, nor in
      motion &#8212; neither like nor unlike &#8212; neither the same with itself
      nor different from itself &#8212; neither Unum nor Multa. Both
      predicates and Subject vanish. Thus all the negations of the first
      Demonstration are justified. Immediately before the <i>Suddenly</i>,
      or point of change, Unum was in motion &#8212; immediately after the
      change, it is at rest: immediately before, it was like &#8212; equal &#8212;
      the same with itself &#8212; Unum, &amp;c. &#8212; immediately after, it is
      unlike &#8212; unequal &#8212; different from itself &#8212; Multa, &amp;c. And thus
      the double and contradictory affirmative predications, of which
      the second Demonstration is composed, are in their turn made good,
      as successive in time. This discovery of the extra-temporal point
      <i>Suddenly</i>, enables Parmenides to uphold both the double
      negative of the first Demonstration, and the double affirmative of
      the second.</p>

        This appears to be an illustration of the doctrine which

        perpetual absorption of each particular into the universal; and

        Demonstrations or Antinomies in each, the first proves the
        Neither, the second proves the Both.</span></p>
    <p>
      The theory here laid down in the third Demonstration respecting
      this extra-temporal point &#8212; the <i>Suddenly</i> &#8212; deserves all
      the more attention, because it applies not merely to the first and
      second Demonstration which precede it, but also to the fourth and
      fifth, the sixth and seventh, the eighth and ninth, which follow
      it. I have already observed, that the first and second
      Demonstration form a corresponding pair, branching off from the
      same root or hypothetical proposition (at least the same in
      terms), respecting the subject <i>Unum</i>; and destined to
      prove, one the Neither, the other the Both, of several different
      predicates. So also the fourth and fifth form a pair applying to
      the subject C&aelig;tera; and destined to prove, that from <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page102" id="v3page102"></a>102</span>the
      same hypothetical root &#8212; <i>Si Unum est</i> &#8212; we can deduce the
      Neither as well as the Both, of various predicates of
      C&aelig;tera. When we pass on to the four last Demonstrations, we
      find that in all four, the hypothesis <i>Si Unum non est</i> is
      substituted for that of <i>Si Unum est</i>: but the parallel
      couples, with the corresponding purpose, are still kept up. The
      sixth and seventh apply to the subject <i>Unum</i>, and
      demonstrate respecting that subject (proceeding from the
      hypothesis <i>Si Unum non est</i>) first the <i>Both</i>, then
      the <i>Neither</i>, of various predicates: the eighth and ninth
      arrive at the same result, respecting the subject <i>C&aelig;tera</i>.
      And a sentence at the close sums up in few words the result of all
      the four pairs (1-2, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, that is, of all the
      Demonstrations excepting the third) &#8212; the Neither and the Both
      respecting all of them.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_27_52"
          id="Sidenotev3_27_52"></a>The third Demonstration is
        mediatorial but not satisfactory &#8212; The hypothesis of the Sudden
        or Instantaneous found no favour.</span></p>
    <p>
      To understand these nine Demonstrations properly, therefore, we
      ought to consider eight among them (1-2, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9) as four
      Antinomies, or couples establishing dialectic contradictions: and
      the third as a mediator satisfactory between the couples &#8212;
      announced as if it reconciled the contradictions of the first
      Antinomy, and capable of being adapted, in the same character with
      certain modifications, to the second, third, and fourth Antinomy.
      Whether it reconciles them successfully &#8212; in other words, whether
      the third Demonstration will itself hold good &#8212; is a different
      question. It will be found to involve the singular and paradoxical
      (Plato&#8217;s own phrase) doctrine of the extra-temporal <i>Suddenly</i>
      &#8212; conceiving Time as a Discretum and not a Continuum. This
      doctrine is intended by Plato here as a means of rendering the
      fact of change logically conceivable and explicable. He first
      states briefly the difficulty (which we know to have been largely
      insisted on by Diodorus Kronus and other Megarics) of logically
      explaining the fact of change &#8212; and then enunciates this doctrine
      as the solution. We plainly see that it did not satisfy others &#8212;
      for the puzzle continued to be a puzzle long after &#8212; and that it
      did not even satisfy Plato, except at the time when he composed
      the Parmenides &#8212; since neither the doctrine itself (the
      extra-temporal break or transition) nor the very peculiar phrase
      in which it is embodied (&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958;&#945;&#943;&#966;&#957;&#951;&#962;, &#7940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;) occur in
      any of his other dialogues. If the doctrine were really tenable,
      it would have been of use in dialectic, and as such, would have <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page103" id="v3page103"></a>103</span>been
      called in to remove the theoretical difficulties raised among
      dialectical disputants, respecting time and motion. Yet Plato does
      not again advert to it, either in Sophistes or Tim&aelig;us, in
      both of which there is special demand for it.<a

      like it (yet without employing the peculiar phrase &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958;&#945;&#943;&#966;&#957;&#951;&#962;) to
      explain qualitative change, does not admit the same either as to
      quantitative change, or as to local motion, or as to generation
      and destruction.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_95"

        extra-temporal break or zero of transition &#8212; as an important
        progress made by Plato, compared with the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
        because it breaks down the absoluten Gegensatz between Sein and
        Werden, Ruhe and Bewegung (Einleitung zum Parmen. p. 309).</p>

    <p>
      <i>Si Unum est</i> &#8212; <i>Si Unum non est</i>. Even from such a
      proposition as the first of these, we might have thought it
      difficult to deduce any string of consequences &#8212; which Plato has
      already done: from such a proposition as the second, not merely
      difficult, but impossible. Nevertheless the ingenious dialectic of
      Plato accomplishes the task, and elicits from each proposition a
      Both, and a Neither, respecting several predicates of Unum as well
      as of C&aelig;tera. When you say <i>Unum non est</i> (so argues
      the Platonic Parmenides in Demonstration 6), you deny existence
      respecting Unum: but the proposition <i>Unum non est</i>, is
      distinguishable from <i>Magnitudo non est</i> &#8212; <i>Parvitudo non
        est</i> &#8212; and such like: propositions wherein the subject is
      different, though the predicate is the same: so that <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page104" id="v3page104"></a>104</span><i>Unum
        non Ens</i> is still a Something knowable, and distinguishable
      from other things &#8212; a logical subject of which various other
      predicates may be affirmed, though the predicate of existence
      cannot be affirmed.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_96"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> It is
      both like and unlike, equal and unequal &#8212; like and equal to itself
      unlike and unequal to other things.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_97"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> These
      its predicates being all true, are also real existences: so that
      Unum partakes <i>quodam modo</i> in existence: though <i>Unum</i>
      be <i>non-Ens</i>, nevertheless, <i>Unum non-Ens est</i>.
      Partaking thus both of non-existence and of existence, it changes:
      it both moves and is at rest: it is generated and destroyed, yet
      is also neither generated nor destroyed.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_98"

      Having thus deduced from the fundamental principle this string of
      Both opposite predicates, the Platonic Parmenides reverts (in
      Demonstration 7) to the same principium (<i>Si Unum non est</i>)
      to deduce by another train of reasoning the Neither of these
      predicates. When you say that <i>Unum non est</i>, you must mean
      that it does not partake of existence in any way &#8212; absolutely and
      without reserve. It therefore neither acquires nor loses
      existence: it is neither generated nor destroyed: it is neither in
      motion nor at rest: it partakes of nothing existent: it is neither
      equal nor unequal &#8212; neither like nor unlike &#8212; neither great nor
      little &#8212; neither this, nor that: neither the object of perception,
      nor of knowledge, nor of opinion, nor of naming, nor of debate.<a

          id="Sidenotev3_27_54"></a>Demonstration VII. is founded upon
        the genuine doctrine of Parmenides.</span></p>
    <p>
      These two last counter-demonstrations (6 and 7), forming the third
      Antinomy, deserve attention in this respect &#8212; That the seventh is
      founded upon the genuine Parmenidean or Eleatic doctrine about
      Non-Ens, as not merely having no attributes, but as being
      unknowable, unperceivable, unnameable: while the sixth is founded
      upon a different apprehension of Non-Ens, which is explained and
      defended by Plato in the Sophistes, as a substitute for, and
      refutation of, the Eleatic doctrine.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_100"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a>
      According to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page105"
          id="v3page105"></a>105</span>Number 7, when you deny, of Unum,
      the predicate existence, you deny of it also all other predicates:
      and the name Unum is left without any subject to apply to. This is
      the Eleatic dogma. Unum having been declared to be Non-Ens, is
      (like Non-Ens) neither knowable nor nameable. According to Number
      6, the proposition <i>Unum est non-Ens</i>, does not carry with
      it any such consequences. Existence is only one predicate, which
      may be denied of the subject Unum, but which, when denied, does
      not lead to the denial of all other predicates &#8212; nor, therefore,
      to the loss of the subject itself. Unum still remains Unum,
      knowable, and different from other things. Upon this first premiss
      are built up several other affirmations; so that we thus arrive
      circuitously at the affirmation of existence, in a certain way: <i>Unum</i>,
      though non-existent, does nevertheless exist <i>quodam modo</i>.
      This coincides with that which the Eleatic stranger seeks to prove
      in the Sophistes, against Parmenides.</p>

        considered &#8212; Unwarrantable steps in the reasoning &#8212; The
        fundamental premiss differently interpreted, though the same in
        words.</span></p>
    <p>
      If we compare the two foregoing counter-demonstrations (7 and 6),
      we shall see that the negative results of the seventh follow
      properly enough from the assumed premisses: but that the
      affirmative results of the sixth are not obtained without very
      unwarrantable jumps in the reasoning, besides its extreme
      subtlety. But apart from this defect, we farther remark that here
      also (as in Numbers 1 and 2) the fundamental principle assumed is
      in terms the same, in signification materially different. The
      signification of <i>Unum non est</i>, as it is construed in
      Number 7, is the natural one, belonging to the words: but as
      construed in Number 6, the meaning of the predicate is altogether
      effaced (as it had been before in Number 1): we cannot tell what
      it is which is really denied about Unum. As, in Number 1, the
      proposition <i>Unum est</i> is so construed as to affirm nothing
      except <i>Unum est Unum</i> &#8212; so in Number 7, the proposition <i>Unum
        non est</i> is so construed as to deny nothing except <i>Unum
        non est Unum</i>, yet conveying along with such denial a farther
      affirmation &#8212; <i>Unum non est Unum, sed tamen est aliquid
        scibile, differens ab aliis</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_101"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> Here
      this <i>aliquid scibile</i> is assumed as a <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page106" id="v3page106"></a>106</span>substratum
      underlying <i>Unum</i>, and remaining even when Unum is taken
      away: contrary to the opinion &#8212; that Unum was a separate nature
      and the fundamental Subject of all &#8212; which Aristotle announces as
      having been held by Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_102"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a> There
      must be always some meaning (the Platonic Parmenides argues)
      attached to the word Unum, even when you talk of <i>Unum non Ens</i>:
      and that meaning is equivalent to <i>Aliquid scibile, differens
        ab aliis</i>. From this he proceeds to evolve, step by step,
      though often in a manner obscure and inconclusive, his series of
      contradictory affirmations respecting Unum. </p>

      The last couple of Demonstrations &#8212; 8 and 9 &#8212; composing the fourth
      Antinomy, are in some respects the most ingenious and singular of
      all the nine. Si <i>Unum non est</i>, what is true about
      C&aelig;tera? The eighth demonstrates the <i>Both</i> of the
      affirmative predicates, the ninth proves the <i>Neither</i>.</p>

        Analysis of Demonstration VIII.</span></p>
    <p>
      Si <i>Unum non est</i> (is the argument of the eighth),
      C&aelig;tera must nevertheless somehow still be C&aelig;tera:
      otherwise you could not talk about C&aelig;tera.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_103" href="#Footnotev3_27_103"><span
          class="sp">103</span></a> (This is an argument like that in
      Demonstration 6: What is talked about must exist, somehow.) But if
      C&aelig;tera can be named and talked about, they must be different
      from something, &#8212; and from something, which is also different from
      them. What can this Something be? Not certainly Unum: for Unum, by
      the Hypothesis, does not exist, and cannot therefore be the term
      of comparison. <i>C&aelig;tera</i> therefore must be different
      among themselves and from each other. But they cannot be compared
      with each other by units: for Unum does not exist. They must
      therefore be compared with each other by heaps or multitudes: each
      of which will appear at first sight to be an unit, though it be
      not an unit in reality. There will be numbers of such heaps, each
      in appearance one, though not in reality:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_104" href="#Footnotev3_27_104"><span
          class="sp">104</span></a> numbers odd and even, great and
      little, in appearance: heaps appearing to be greater and less than
      each other, and equal to each other, though not being really so.
      Each of these heaps will appear to have a beginning, middle, and
      end, yet will not really have any such: <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page107" id="v3page107"></a>107</span>for whenever you
      grasp any one of them in your thoughts, there will appear another
      beginning before the beginning,<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_105"
        href="#Footnotev3_27_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a>
      another end after the end, another centre more centrical than the
      centre, &#8212; minima ever decreasing because you cannot reach any
      stable unit. Each will be a heap without any unity; looking like
      one, at a distance, &#8212; but when you come near, each a boundless and
      countless multitude. They will thus appear one and many, like and
      unlike, equal and unequal, at rest and moving, separate and
      coalescing: in short, invested with an indefinite number of
      opposite attributes.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_106"

        and Zenonian.</span></p>
    <p>
      This Demonstration 8, with its strange and subtle chain of
      inferences, purporting to rest upon the admission of C&aelig;tera
      without Unum, brings out the antithesis of the Apparent and the
      Real, which had not been noticed in the preceding demonstrations.
      Demonstration 8 is in its character Zenonian. It probably
      coincides with the proof which Zeno is reported (in the earlier
      half of this dialogue) to have given against the existence of any
      real Multa. If you assume Multa (Zeno argued), they must be both
      like and unlike, and invested with many other opposite attributes;
      but this is impossible; therefore the assumption is untrue.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_27_107" href="#Footnotev3_27_107"><span
          class="sp">107</span></a> Those against whom Zeno reasoned,
      contended for real Multa, and against a real Unum. Zeno probably
      showed, and our eighth Demonstration here shows also, &#8212; that Multa
      under this supposition are nothing real, but an assemblage of
      indefinite, ever-variable, contradictory appearances: an &#7948;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957;,
      Infinite, or Chaos: an object not real and absolute, but relative
      and variable according to the point of view of the subject.</p>

        following <i>Both</i>.</span></p>
    <p>
      To the eighth Demonstration, ingenious as it is, succeeds a
      countervailing reversal in the ninth: the Neither following the
      Both. The fundamental supposition is in terms the same. <i>Si
        Unum non est</i>, what is to become<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page108" id="v3page108"></a>108</span> of <i>C&aelig;tera</i>?
      <i>C&aelig;tera</i> are not <i>Unum</i>: yet neither are they <i>Multa</i>:
      for if there were any Multa, Unum would be included in them. If
      none of the Multa were Unum, all of them would be nothing at all,
      and there would be no Multa. If therefore Unum be not included in
      C&aelig;tera, C&aelig;tera would be neither Unum nor Multa: nor
      would they appear to be either Unum or Multa: for C&aelig;tera can
      have no possible communion with Non-Entia: nor can any of the
      Non-Entia be present along with any of C&aelig;tera &#8212; since
      Non-Entia have no parts. We cannot therefore conceive or represent
      to ourselves Non-Ens as along with or belonging to C&aelig;tera.
      Therefore, <i>Si Unum non est</i>, nothing among <i>C&aelig;tera</i>
      is conceived either as Unum or as Multa: for to conceive Multa
      without Unum is impossible. It thus appears, <i>Si Unum non est</i>,
      that C&aelig;tera neither are Unum nor Multa. Nor are they
      conceived either as Unum or Multa &#8212; either as like or as unlike &#8212;
      either as the same or as different &#8212; either as in contact or as
      apart. &#8212; In short, all those attributes which in the last
      preceding Demonstration were shown <i>to belong to them</i> in
      appearance, are now shown <i>not to belong</i> to them either in
      appearance or in reality.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_108"

        solution. Plato did not.</span></p>
    <p>
      The close of the Parmenides, as it stands here, may be fairly
      compared to the enigma announced by Plato in his Republic &#8212; &#8220;A man
      and no man, struck and did not <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page109" id="v3page109"></a>109</span>strike, with a
      stone and no stone, a bird and no bird, sitting upon wood and no
      wood&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_27_110" href="#Footnotev3_27_110"><span
          class="sp">110</span></a> This is an enigma, propounded for
      youthful auditors to guess: stimulating their curiosity, and
      tasking their intelligence to find it out. As far as I can see,
      the puzzling antinomies in the Parmenides have no other purpose.
      They drag back the forward and youthful Sokrates from affirmative
      dogmatism to negative doubt and embarrassment. There is however
      this difference between the enigma in the Republic, and the
      Antinomies in the Parmenides. The constructor of the enigma had
      certainly a preconceived solution to which he adapted the
      conditions of his problem: whereas we have no sufficient ground
      for asserting that the author of the Antinomies had any such
      solution present or operative in his mind. How much of truth Plato
      may himself have recognised, or may have wished others to
      recognise, in them, we have no means of determining. We find in
      them many equivocal propositions and unwarranted inferences &#8212; much
      blending of truth with error, intentionally or unintentionally.
      The veteran Parmenides imposes the severance of the two, as a
      lesson, upon his youthful hearers Sokrates and Aristoteles.</p>

    <p>
      In this dialogue, as in the Parmenides immediately preceding,
      Plato dwells upon the intellectual operations of mind: introducing
      the ethical and emotional only in a partial and subordinate way.
      The main question canvassed is, What is Knowledge &#8212; Cognition &#8212;
      Science? After a long debate, turning the question over in many
      distinct points of view, and examining three or four different
      answers to the question &#8212; all these answers are successively
      rejected, and the problem remains unsolved. </p>
    <p>
      The two persons who converse with Sokrates are, Theod&ocirc;rus,
      an elderly man, eminent as a geometrician, astronomer, &amp;c.,
      and teaching those sciences &#8212; and The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, a young
      man of great merit and still greater promise: acute, intelligent,
      and inquisitive &#8212; high-principled and courageous in the field, yet
      gentle and conciliatory to all: lastly, resembling Sokrates in
      physiognomy and in the flatness of his nose. The dialogue is
      supposed to have taken place during the last weeks of the life of
      Sokrates, when his legal appearance as defendant is required to
      answer the indictment of Mel&ecirc;tus, already entered in the
      official record.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_1" href="#Footnotev3_28_1"><span

        Plato, The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. i. pp. 142 E, 143 A. Plato hardly
        keeps up the fiction about the time of this dialogue with
        perfect consistency. When it took place, the indictment of
        Mel&ecirc;tus had already been recorded: Sokrates breaks off the
        conversation for the purpose of going to answer it: Eukleides
        hears the dialogue from the mouth of Sokrates afterwards.
        &#8220;Immediately on getting home to Megara&#8221; (says Eukleides) &#8220;I
        wrote down memoranda (of what I had heard): then afterwards I
        called it back to my mind at leisure, and as often as I visited
        Athens I questioned Sokrates about such portions as I did not
        remember, and made corrections on my return here, so that now
        nearly all the dialogue has been written out.&#8221; </p>
      <p>
        Such a process would require longer time than is consistent with
        the short remainder of the life of Sokrates. Socher indeed tries
        to explain this by assuming a long interval between the
        indictment and the trial, but this is noway satisfactory. (Ueber
        Platon&#8217;s Schriften, p. 251.) </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Lewis Campbell, in the Preface to his very useful edition of
        this dialogue (p. lxxi. Oxford, 1861), considers that the battle
        in which The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is represented as having been
        wounded, is probably meant for that battle in which Iphikrates
        and his peltasts destroyed the Spartan Mora, <span
          class="smcap">B.C.</span> 390: if not that, then the battle at
        the Isthmus of Corinth against Epaminondas. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        369. Schleiermacher in his Einleitung to the dialogue (p. 185)
        seems to prefer the supposition of some earlier battle or
        skirmish under Iphikrates. The point can hardly be determined.
        Still less can we fix the date at which the dialogue was
        written, though the mention of the battle of Corinth certifies
        that it was later than 394 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Ast
        affirms confidently that it was the first dialogue composed by
        Plato after the Ph&aelig;don, which last was composed
        immediately after the death of Sokrates (Ast, Platon&#8217;s Leben,
        &amp;c., p. 192). I see no ground for this affirmation. Most of
        the commentators rank it among the dialectical dialogues, which
        they consider to belong to a later period of Plato&#8217;s life than
        the ethical, but to an earlier period than the constructive,
        such as Republic, Tim&aelig;us, &amp;c. Most of them place the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus in one or other of the years between
        393-383 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, though they differ
        much among themselves whether it is to be considered as later or
        earlier than other dialogues &#8212; Kratylus, Euthydemus, Menon,
        Gorgias, &amp;c. (Stallbaum, Proleg. The&aelig;t. pp. 6-10;
        Steinhart, Einleit. zum The&aelig;t. pp. 100-213.) Munk and
        Ueberweg, on the contrary, place the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus at a
        date considerably later, subsequent to 368 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        Munk assigns it to 358 or 357 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
        after Plato&#8217;s last return from Sicily (Munk, Die nat&uuml;rliche
        Ordnung der Platon. Schr. pp. 357-597: Ueberweg, Ueber die

        knowledge or Cognition? First answer of The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
        enumerating many different cognitions. Corrected by Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>
      In answer to the question put by Sokrates &#8212; What is Knowledge or
      Cognition? The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus at first replies &#8212; That there are
      many and diverse cognitions:&#8212; of geometry, of arithmetic, of arts
      and trades, such as shoemaking, joinery, &amp;c. Sokrates points
      out (as in the Menon, Hippias Major, and other dialogues) that
      such an answer involves a misconception of the question: which was
      general, and required a general answer, setting forth the
      characteristic common to all cognitions. No one can know what
      cognition is in shoemaking or any particular case &#8212; unless he
      first knows what is cognition generally.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_3"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Specimens
      of suitable answers to general questions are then given (or of

      have already observed more than once how important an object it
      was with Plato to impress upon his readers an exact and adequate
      conception of the meaning of general terms, and the proper way of
      defining them. For this purpose he brings into contrast the
      misconceptions likely to arise in the minds of persons not
      accustomed to dialectic.</p>

    <p>
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, before he attempts a second answer,
      complains how much the subject had embarrassed him. Impressed with
      what he had heard about the interrogatories of Sokrates, he had
      tried to solve this problem: but he had not been able to satisfy
      himself with any attempted solution &#8212; nor yet to relinquish the
      search altogether. &#8220;You are in distress, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus&#8221;

      You have that within you, of which you need to be relieved; and
      you cannot be relieved without obstetric aid. It is my peculiar
      gift from the Gods to afford such aid, and to stimulate the
      parturition of pregnant minds which cannot of themselves bring
      forth what is within them.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_6"

      others, and test the answers given by others: so as to determine
      whether such answers are true and valuable, or false and
      worthless. I can teach nothing: I only bring out what is already
      struggling in the minds of youth: and if there be nothing within
      them, my procedure is unavailing. My most important function is,
      to test the answers given, how far they are true or false. But
      most people, not comprehending my drift, complain of me as a most
      eccentric person, who only makes others sceptical. They reproach
      me, and that truly enough, with always asking questions, and never

      favourable to them: others again become tired of me, and go away
      too soon, so that the little good which I have done them becomes
      effaced. Occasionally, some of these impatient companions wish to

    <p>
      This passage, while it forcibly depicts the peculiar intellectual
      gift of Sokrates, illustrates at the same time the Platonic manner
      of describing, full of poetry and metaphor. Cross-examination by
      Sokrates communicated nothing new, but brought out what lay buried
      in the mind of the respondent, and tested the value of his
      answers. It was applicable only to minds endowed and productive:
      but for them it was indispensable, in order to extract what they
      were capable of producing, and to test its value when extracted.
      &#8220;Do not think me unkind,&#8221; (says Sokrates,) &#8220;or my procedure
      useless, if my scrutiny exposes your answers as fallacious. Many
      respondents have been violently angry with me for doing so: but I
      feel myself strictly forbidden either to admit falsehood, or to
      put aside truth.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_9" href="#Footnotev3_28_9"><span

        Cognition is sensible perception: Sokrates says that this is the
        same doctrine as the <i>Homo Mensura</i> laid down by
        Protagoras, and that both are in close affinity with the
        doctrines of Homer, Herakleitus, Empedokl&ecirc;s, &amp;c., all
        except Parmenides.</span></p>
    <p>
      The first answer given by The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is &#8212; &#8220;Cognition is
      sensation (or sensible perception)&#8221;. Upon this answer Sokrates
      remarks, that it is the same doctrine, though in other words, as
      what was laid down by Protagoras &#8212; &#8220;Man is the measure of all
      things: of things existent, that they exist: of things
      non-existent, that they do not exist. As things appear to me, so
      they <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page114" id="v3page114"></a>114</span>are
      to me: as they appear to you, so they are to you.&#8221;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_10" href="#Footnotev3_28_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> Sokrates then proceeds to say, that
      these two opinions are akin to, or identical with, the general
      view of nature entertained by Herakleitus, Empedokl&ecirc;s, and
      other philosophers, countenanced moreover by poets like Homer and
      Epicharmus. The philosophers here noticed (he continues), though
      differing much in other respects, all held the doctrine that
      nature consisted in a perpetual motion, change, or flux: that
      there was no real Ens or permanent substratum, but perpetual
      genesis or transition.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_11"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> These
      philosophers were opposed to Parmenides, who maintained (as I have
      already stated in a previous chapter) that there was nothing real
      except Ens &#8212; One, permanent, and unchangeable: that all change was
      unreal, apparent, illusory, not capable of being certainly known,
      but only matter of uncertain opinion or estimation.</p>

        Here Plato appears to transcribe the words of Protagoras
        (compare p. 161 B, and the Kratylus, p. 386 A) which distinctly
        affirm the doctrine of <i>Homo Mensura</i> &#8212; Man is the measure
        of all things, &#8212; but do not affirm the doctrine, that knowledge
        is sensible perception. The identification between the two
        doctrines is asserted by Plato himself. It is Plato who asserts
        &#8220;that Protagoras affirmed the same doctrine in another manner,&#8221;
        citing afterwards the manner in which he supposed Protagoras to
        affirm it. If there had been in the treatise of Protagoras any
        more express or peremptory affirmation of the doctrine &#8220;that
        knowledge is sensible perception,&#8221; Plato would probably have
        given it here.</p>

        distinct theories for the purpose of confuting them; yet he also

    <p>
      The one main theme intended for examination here (as Sokrates<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_12" href="#Footnotev3_28_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> expressly declares) is the doctrine &#8212;
      That Cognition is sensible perception. Nevertheless upon all the
      three opinions, thus represented as cognate or identical,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_13" href="#Footnotev3_28_13"><span
          class="sp">13</span></a> Sokrates bestows a lengthened comment
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page115" id="v3page115"></a>115</span>(occupying
      a half of the dialogue) in conversation, principally with
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, but partly also with Theod&ocirc;rus. His
      strictures are not always easy to follow with assurance, because
      he often passes with little notice from one to the other of the
      three doctrines which he is examining: because he himself, though
      really opposed to them, affects in part to take them up and to
      suggest arguments in their favour: and further because,
      disclaiming all positive opinion of his own, he sometimes leaves
      us in doubt what is his real purpose &#8212; whether to expound, or to
      deride, the opinions of others &#8212; whether to enlighten
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, or to test his power of detecting
      fallacies.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_14" href="#Footnotev3_28_14"><span
          class="sp">14</span></a> We cannot always distinguish between
      the ironical and the serious. Lastly, it is a still greater
      difficulty, that we have not before us either of the three
      opinions as set forth by their proper supporters. There remains no
      work either of Protagoras or of Herakleitus: so that we do not
      clearly know the subject matter upon which Plato is commenting &#8212;
      nor whether these authors would have admitted as just the view
      which he takes of their opinions.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_15"

        It would be hardly necessary to remark, that when Plato
        professes to put a pleading into the mouth of Protagoras (pp.
        165-166) we have no other real speaker than Plato himself, if
        commentators did not often forget this. Steinhart indeed tells
        us (Einleit. zum The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. pp. 36-47) positively &#8212;
        that Plato in this pleading keeps in the most accurate manner
        (auf das genaueste) to the thoughts of Protagoras, perhaps even
        to his words. How Steinhart can know this I am at a loss to
        understand. To me it seems very improbable. The mere
        circumstance that Plato forces into partnership three distinct
        theories, makes it probable that he did not adhere to the
        thoughts or language of any one of them.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_7"

        completely distinct from the other doctrines. The identification
        of them as one and the same is only constructive &#8212; the
        interpretation of Plato himself.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is not improbable that the three doctrines, here put together
      by Plato and subjected to a common scrutiny, may have been
      sometimes held by the same philosophers. Nevertheless, the
      language<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_16" href="#Footnotev3_28_16"><span
          class="sp">16</span></a> of Plato himself shows us that
      Protagoras never expressly affirmed knowledge to be sensible
      Perception: and that the substantial identity between this
      doctrine, and the different doctrine maintained by Protagoras, is
      to be regarded as a construction put upon the two by Plato. That
      the theories of Herakleitus and Empedokles differed <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page116" id="v3page116"></a>116</span>materially
      from each other, we know certainly: the theory of each, moreover,
      differed from the doctrine of Protagoras &#8212; &#8220;Man is the measure of
      all things&#8221;. How this last doctrine was defended by its
      promulgator, we cannot say. But the defence of it noway required
      him to maintain &#8212; That knowledge is sensible perception. It might
      be consistently held by one who rejected that definition of
      knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_17" href="#Footnotev3_28_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a> And though Plato tries to refute
      both, yet the reasonings which he brings against one do not at all
      tell against the other. </p>

        Dr. Routh, in a note upon his edition of the Euthyd&ecirc;mus of
        Plato (p. 286 C) observes:&#8212; &#8220;Protagoras docebat, &#928;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;
        &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#8033;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&middot; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8052;

        sensilium sine animi perceptione existentiam sustulisse
        videtur.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        The definition here given by Routh is correct as far as it goes,
        though too narrow. But it is sufficient to exhibit the
        Protagorean doctrine as quite distinct from the other doctrine,

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_8"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_8"></a>Explanation of the doctrine of
        Protagoras &#8212; <i>Homo Mensura</i>.</span></p>
    <p>
      The Protagorean doctrine &#8212; Man is the measure of all things &#8212; is
      simply the presentation in complete view of a common fact &#8212;
      uncovering an aspect of it which the received phraseology hides.
      Truth and Falsehood have reference to some believing subject &#8212; and
      the words have no meaning except in that relation. Protagoras
      brings to view this subjective side of the same complex fact, of
      which Truth and Falsehood denote the objective side. He refuses to
      admit the object absolute &#8212; the pretended <i>thing in itself</i>
      &#8212; Truth without a believer. His doctrine maintains the
      indefeasible and necessary involution of the percipient mind in
      every perception &#8212; of the concipient mind in every conception &#8212; of
      the cognizant mind in every cognition. Farther, Protagoras
      acknowledges many distinct believing or knowing Subjects: and
      affirms that every object known must be relative to (or in his
      language, <i>measured by</i>) the knowing Subject: that every <i>cognitum</i>
      must have its <i>cognoscens</i>, and every <i>cognoscibile</i>
      its <i>cognitionis capax</i>: that the words have no meaning
      unless this be supposed: that these two names designate two
      opposite poles or aspects of the indivisible fact of cognition &#8212;
      actual or potential &#8212; not two factors, which are in themselves
      separate or separable, and which come together to make a compound
      product. A man cannot in any case get clear of or discard his own
      mind as a Subject. Self is necessarily omnipresent; <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page117" id="v3page117"></a>117</span>concerned
      in every moment of consciousness, and equally concerned in all,
      though more distinctly attended to in some than in others.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_18" href="#Footnotev3_28_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> The Subject, self, or Ego, is that
      which all our moments of consciousness have in common and alike:
      Object is that in which they do or may differ &#8212; although some
      object or other there always must be. The position laid down by
      Descartes &#8212; <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i> &#8212; might have been stated with
      equal truth &#8212; <i>Cogito, ergo est (cogitatum aliquid)</i>: <i>sum
        cogitans &#8212; est cogitatum</i> &#8212; are two opposite aspects of the
      same indivisible mental fact &#8212; <i>cogitatio</i>. In some cases,
      doubtless, the objective aspect may absorb our attention,
      eclipsing the subjective: in other cases, the subjective attracts
      exclusive notice: but in all cases and in every act of
      consciousness, both are involved as co-existent and correlative.
      That alone exists, to every man, which stands, or is believed by
      him to be capable of standing, in some mode of his consciousness
      as an Object correlative with himself as a Subject. If he believes
      in its existence, his own believing mind is part and parcel of
      such fact of belief, not less than the object believed in: if he
      disbelieves it, his own disbelieving mind is the like.
      Consciousness in all varieties has for its two poles Subject and
      Object: there cannot be one of these poles without the opposite
      pole &#8212; north without south &#8212; any more than there can be concave
      without convex (to use a comparison familiar with Aristotle), or
      front <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page118" id="v3page118"></a>118</span>
      without back: which are not two things originally different and
      coming into conjunction, but two different aspects of the same
      indivisible fact.</p>

        In regard to the impossibility of carrying abstraction so far as
        to discard the thinking subject, see Hobbes, Computation or
        Logic, ch. vii. 1.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;In the teaching of natural philosophy I cannot begin better
        than from <i>privation</i>; that is, from feigning the world to
        be annihilated. But if such annihilation of all things be
        supposed, it may perhaps be asked what would remain for any man
        (<i>whom only I except from this universal annihilation of
          things</i>) to consider as the subject of philosophy, or at
        all to reason upon; or what to give names unto for
        ratiocination&#8217;s sake.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I say, therefore, there would remain to that man ideas of the
        world, and of all such bodies as he had, before their
        annihilation, seen with his eyes, or perceived by any other
        sense; that is to say, the memory and imagination of magnitudes,
        motions, sounds, colours, &amp;c., as also of their order and
        parts. All which things, though they be nothing but ideas and
        phantasms, happening internally to him that imagineth, yet they
        will appear as if they were external and not at all depending
        upon any power of the mind. And these are the things to which he
        would give names and subtract them from, and compound them with
        one another. For seeing that after the destruction of all other
        things I suppose man still remaining, and namely that he thinks,
        imagines, and remembers, there can be nothing for him to think
        of but what is past.&#8230; Now things may be considered, that is, be
        brought into account, <i>either as internal accidents of our
          mind</i>, in which manner we consider them when the question
        is about <i>some faculty of the mind</i>: or, as <i>species of
          external things, not as really existing, but appearing only to
          exist, or to have a being without us</i>. And in this manner
        we are now to consider them.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      In declaring that &#8220;Man is the measure of all things&#8221; &#8212; Protagoras
      affirms that Subject is the measure of Object, or that every
      object is relative to a correlative Subject. When a man affirms,
      believes, or conceives, an object as existing, his own believing
      or concipient mind is one side of the entire fact. It may be the
      dark side, and what is called <i>the Object</i> may be the light
      side, of the entire fact: this is what happens in the case of
      tangible and resisting substances, where Object, being the light
      side of the fact, is apt to appear all in all:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_19" href="#Footnotev3_28_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> a man thinks of the Something which
      resists, without attending to the other aspect of the fact of
      resistance, <i>viz.</i>: his own energy or pressure, to which
      resistance is made. On the other hand, when we speak of enjoying
      any pleasure or suffering any pain, the enjoying or suffering
      Subject appears all in all, distinguished plainly from other
      Subjects, supposed to be not enjoying or suffering in the same
      way: yet it is no more than the light side of the fact, of which
      Object is the dark side. Each particular pain which we suffer has
      its objective or differential peculiarity, distinguishing it from
      other sensations, correlating with the same sentient Subject.</p>

        &#8220;In the primitive dualism of consciousness, the Subject and

          id="Sidenotev3_28_10"></a>Such relativity is no less true in
        regard to the ratiocinative combinations of each individual,
        than in regard to his percipient capacities.</span></p>
    <p>
      The Protagorean dictum will thus be seen, when interpreted
      correctly, to be quite distinct from that other doctrine with
      which Plato identifies it: that Cognition is nothing else but
      sensible Perception. If, rejecting this last doctrine, we hold
      that cognition includes mental elements distinct from, though
      co-operating with, sensible perception &#8212; the principle of
      relativity laid down by Protagoras will not be the less true. My
      intellectual activity &#8212; my powers of remembering, imagining,
      ratiocinating, combining, &amp;c., are a part of <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page119" id="v3page119"></a>119</span>my
      mental nature, no less than my powers of sensible perception: my
      cognitions and beliefs must all be determined by, or relative to,
      this mental nature: to the turn and development which all these
      various powers have taken in my individual case. However
      multifarious the mental activities may be, each man has his own
      peculiar allotment and manifestations thereof, to which his
      cognitions must be relative. Let us grant (with Plato) that the
      Nous or intelligent Mind apprehends intelligible Entia or Ideas
      distinct from the world of sense: or let us assume that Kant and
      Reid in the eighteenth century, and M. Cousin with other French
      writers in the nineteenth, have destroyed the Lockian philosophy,
      which took account (they say) of nothing but the <i>&agrave;
        posteriori</i> element of cognition &#8212; and have established the
      existence of other elements of cognition <i>&agrave; priori</i>:
      intuitive beliefs, first principles, primary or inexplicable
      Concepts of Reason.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_20"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Still we
      must recollect that all such <i>&agrave; priori</i> Concepts,
      Intuitions, Beliefs, &amp;c., are summed up in the mind: and that
      thus each man&#8217;s mind, with its peculiar endowments, natural or
      supernatural, is still the measure or limit of his cognitions,
      acquired and acquirable. The Entia Rationis exist relatively to <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page120" id="v3page120"></a>120</span>Ratio,
      as the Entia Perceptionis exist relatively to Sense. This is a
      point upon which Plato himself insists, in this very dialogue. You
      do not, by producing this fact of innate mental intuitions,
      eliminate the intuent mind; which must be done in order to
      establish a negative to the Protagorean principle.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_21" href="#Footnotev3_28_21"><span
          class="sp">21</span></a> Each intuitive belief whether correct
      or erroneous &#8212; whether held unanimously by every one <i>semper et
        ubique</i>, or only held by a proportion of mankind &#8212; is (or
      would be, if proved to exist) a fact of our <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page121" id="v3page121"></a>121</span>nature; capable
      of being looked at either on the side of the believing Subject,
      which is its point of community with all other parts of our nature
      &#8212; or on the side of the Object believed, which is its point of
      difference or peculiarity. The fact with its two opposite aspects
      is indivisible. Without Subject, Object vanishes: without Object
      (some object or other, for this side of the fact is essentially
      variable), Subject vanishes.</p>

        M. Jouffroy, following in the steps of Kant, declares these <i>&agrave;
          priori</i> beliefs or intuitions to be altogether relative to
        the human mind. &#8220;Kant, consid&eacute;rant que les conceptions de
        la raison sont des croyances aveugles auxquelles notre esprit se
        sent fatalement d&eacute;termin&eacute; par sa nature, en
        conclut qu&#8217;elles sont r&eacute;latives &agrave; cette nature:
        que si notre nature &eacute;tait autre, elles pourraient
        &ecirc;tre diff&eacute;rentes: que par cons&eacute;quent, elles
        n&#8217;ont aucune valeur absolue: et qu&#8217;ainsi notre
        v&eacute;rit&eacute;, notre science, notre certitude, sont une
        v&eacute;rit&eacute;, une science, une certitude, purement <i>subjective</i>,
        purement humaine &#8212; &agrave; laquelle nous sommes
        d&eacute;termin&eacute;s &agrave; nous fier par notre nature,
        mais qui ne supporte pas l&#8217;examen et n&#8217;a aucune valeur <i>objective</i>&#8221;
        (p. clxvii.) &#8230; &#8220;C&#8217;est ce que r&eacute;p&eacute;te Kant quand il
        soutient que l&#8217;on ne peut <i>objectiver le subjectif</i>: c&#8217;est
        &agrave; dire, faire que la v&eacute;rit&eacute; humaine cesse
        d&#8217;&ecirc;tre humaine, puisque la raison qui la trouve est
        humaine. On peut exprimer de vingt mani&egrave;res
        diff&eacute;rentes cette impossibilit&eacute;: elle reste

        M. Pascal Galuppi (in his Lettres Philosophiques sur les
        Vicissitudes de la Philosophie, translated from the Italian by
        M. Peisse, Paris, 1844) though not agreeing in this variety of <i>&agrave;
          priori</i> philosophy, agrees with Kant in declaring the <i>&agrave;
          priori</i> element of cognition to be purely subjective, and
        the objective element to be <i>&agrave; posteriori</i> (Lett.
        xiv. pp. 337-338), or the facts of sense and experience.
        &#8220;L&#8217;ordre <i>&agrave; priori</i>, que Kant appelle <i>transcendental</i>,
        est purement id&eacute;al, et d&eacute;pourvu de toute
        r&eacute;alit&eacute;. Je vis, qu&#8217;en fondant la connaissance sur
        l&#8217;ordre <i>&agrave; priori</i>, on arrive n&eacute;cessairement
        au scepticisme: et je reconnus que la doctrine &Eacute;cossaise
        est la m&egrave;re l&eacute;gitime du Criticisme Kantien, et par
        cons&eacute;quent, du scepticisme, qui est la cons&eacute;quence
        de la philosophie critique. Je consid&eacute;rai comme de haute
        importance ce probl&egrave;me de Kant. Il convient de
        d&eacute;terminer ce qu&#8217;il y a d&#8217;objectif, et ce qu&#8217;il y a de
        subjectif, dans la connaissance. Les Empiriques n&#8217;admettent dans

        See this point handled in Sextus Empiric. adv. Mathemat. viii.
        355-362. We may here cite a remark of Simplikius in his
        Commentary on the Categories of Aristotle (p. 64, a. in Schol.
        Brandis). Aristotle (De Anim&acirc;, iii. 2, 426, a. 19;
        Categor. p. 7, b. 23) lays down the doctrine that in most cases
        Relata or (&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;) are &#8220;simul Natur&acirc;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#8150;
        &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#945;&#8221;: but that in some Relata this is not true: for example,
        &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; is relative to &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, yet still <i>it would
          seem prior</i> to &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; (&#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7938;&#957; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#949; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;&#962;

        is <i>simul natur&acirc;</i> with &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; (or cognitio) and

      <p>
        We see from hence that Simplikius recognises Concepts,
        Abstractions, and Fictions, to be dependent on the Conceiving,
        Abstracting, Imagining, Mind &#8212; as distinguished from objects of
        Sense, which he does not recognise as dependent in the like
        manner. He agrees in the doctrine of Protagoras as to the
        former, but not as to the latter. This illustrates what I have
        affirmed, That the Protagorean doctrine of &#8220;<i>Homo Mensura</i>&#8221;
        is not only unconnected with the other principle (that Knowledge
        is resolvable into sensible perception) to which Aristotle and
        Plato would trace it &#8212; but that there is rather a repugnance
        between the two. The difficulty of proving the doctrine, and the
        reluctance to admit it, is greatest in the case of material
        objects, least in the case of Abstractions, and General Ideas.
        Yet Aristotle, in reasoning against the Protagorean doctrine
        (Metaphysic. &#915;. pp. 1009-1010, &amp;c.) treats it like Plato, as
        a sort of corollary from the theory that Cognition is Sensible
        Perception.</p>
      <p>
        Simplikius farther observes (p. 65, b. 14) that Aristotle is not
        accurate in making &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; correlate with &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;: that in
        Relata, the potential correlates with the potential, and the
        actual with the actual. The Cognoscible is correlative, not with
        actual cognition (&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;) but with potential Cognition, or
        with a potential Cognoscens. Aristotle therefore is right in
        saying that there may be &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; without &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, but this
        does not prove what he wishes to establish.</p>
      <p>
        Themistius, in another passage of the Aristotelian Scholia,
        reasoning against Boethus, observes to the same effect as
        Simplikius, that in relatives, the actual correlates with the
        actual, and the potential with the potential:&#8212; </p>

        implication of Subject and Object, in regard to the intelligible
        world.</span></p>
    <p>
      That this general doctrine is true, not merely respecting the
      facts of sense, but also respecting the facts of mental
      conception, opinion, intellection, cognition &#8212; may be seen by the
      reasoning of Plato himself in other dialogues. How, for example,
      does Plato prove, in his Tim&aelig;us, the objective reality of
      Ideas or Forms? He infers them from the subjective facts of his
      own mind. The subjective fact called Cognition (he argues) is
      generically different from the subjective fact called True
      Opinion: therefore the Object correlating with the One must be
      distinct from the Object correlating with the other: there must be
      a Noumenon or &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953; correlating with Nous, distinct from the
      &#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953; which correlates with &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_22"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> So
      again, in the Ph&aelig;don,<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_23"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Sokrates
      proves the pre-existence of the human soul from the fact that
      there were pre-existent cognizable Ideas: if there were knowable
      Objects, there must also have been a Subject <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page122" id="v3page122"></a>122</span>Cognoscens
      or Cognitionis capax. The two are different aspects of one and the
      same conception: upon which we may doubtless reason abstractedly
      under one aspect or under the other, though they cannot be
      separated in fact. Now Both these two inferences of Plato rest on
      the assumed implication of Subject and Object.<a

        <i>Nous</i>, according to Plato (Tim. 51 E), belongs only to the

        I think that the inference in the Ph&aelig;don is not necessary
        to prove that conclusion, nor in itself just. For when I speak
        of Augustus and Antony as having once lived, and as having
        fought the battle of Actium, it is noway necessary that I should
        believe myself to have been then alive and to have seen them:
        nor when I speak of civil war as being now carried on in the
        United States of America, is it necessary that I should believe
        myself to be or to have been on the spot as a percipient
        witness. I believe, on evidence which appears to me
        satisfactory, that both these are real facts: that is, if I had
        been at Actium on the day of the battle, or if I were now in the
        United States, I should see and witness the facts here affirmed.
        These latter words describe the subjective side of the fact,
        without introducing any supposition that I have been myself
        present and percipient.</p>

    <p>
      In truth, the Protagorean measure or limit is even more plainly
      applicable to our mental intuitions and mental processes
      (remembering, imagining, conceiving, comparing, abstracting,
      combining of hypotheses, transcendental or inductive) than to the
      matter of our sensible experience.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_25"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> In
      regard to the Entia Rationis, divergence between one theorist and
      another is quite as remarkable as the divergence between one
      percipient and another in the most disputable region of Entia
      Perceptionis. Upon the separate facts of sense, there is a nearer
      approach to unanimity among mankind, than upon the theories
      whereby theorising men connect together those facts to their own
      satisfaction. An opponent of Protagoras would draw his most
      plausible arguments from the undisputed facts of sense. He would
      appeal to matter and what are called its primary <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page123" id="v3page123"></a>123</span>qualities,
      as refuting the doctrine. For in describing mental intuitions,
      Mind or Subject cannot well be overlaid or ignored: but in regard
      to the external world, or material substance with its primary
      qualities, the objective side is so lighted up and magnified in
      the ordinary conception and language &#8212; and the subjective side so
      darkened and put out of sight &#8212; that Object appears as if it stood
      single, apart, and independent.</p>

        Bacon remarks that the processes called mental or intellectual

        Nemesius, the Christian Platonist, has a remark bearing upon
        this question. He says that the lower animals have their
        intellectual movements all determined by Nature, which acts
        alike in all the individuals of the species, but that the human
        intellect is not wholly determined by Nature; it has a freer
        range, larger stores of ideas, and more varied combinations:

      A man conceives objects, like houses and trees, as existing when
      he does not actually see or touch them, just as much as when he
      does see or touch them. He conceives them as existing independent
      of any actual sensations of his own: and he proceeds to describe
      them as independent altogether of himself as a Subject &#8212; or as
      absolute, not relative, existences. But this distinction, though
      just as applied in ordinary usage, becomes inadmissable when
      brought to contradict the Protagorean doctrine; because the
      speaker professes to exclude, what cannot be excluded, himself as
      concipient Subject.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_26"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> It is he
      who conceives <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page124"
          id="v3page124"></a>124</span>absent objects as real and
      existing, though he neither sees nor touches them: he believes
      fully, that if he were in a certain <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page125" id="v3page125"></a>125</span>position near
      them, he would experience those appropriate sensations of sight
      and touch, whereby they are identified. Though he eliminates
      himself as a <i>percipient</i>, he cannot eliminate himself as a
      <i>concipient</i>: <i>i.e.</i>, as conceiving and believing. He
      can conceive no object without being himself the Subject
      conceiving, nor believe in any future contingency without being
      himself the Subject believing. He may part company with himself as
      percipient, but he cannot part company with himself altogether.
      His conception of an absent external object, therefore, when fully
      and accurately described, does not contradict the Protagorean
      doctrine. But it is far the most plausible objection which can be
      brought against that doctrine, and it is an objection deduced from
      the facts or cognitions of sense.</p>

        Bishop Berkeley observes:&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine
        trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet,
        and nobody by to perceive them. I answer, you may so &#8212; there is
        no difficulty in it. But what is all this, more than framing in
        your mind certain ideas which you call <i>books</i> and <i>trees</i>,
        and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that
        may perceive them? <i>But do not you yourself perceive or think
          of them all the while?</i> This therefore is nothing to the
        purpose. It only shows you have the power of imagining or
        forming ideas in your mind: but it doth not show that you can
        conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist
        without the mind. <i>To make out this, it is necessary that you
          conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of, which is a
          manifest repugnancy.</i> When we do our utmost to conceive the
        existence of external bodies, we are all the while only
        contemplating our own ideas. <i>But the mind, taking no notice
          of itself, is deluded to think it can and doth conceive bodies
          existing unthought of or without the mind, though at the same
          time they are apprehended by or exist in itself.</i>&#8221;</p>

        Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge, sect. xxiii. p. 34, ed.
        of Berkeley&#8217;s Works, 1820. The same argument is enforced in
        Berkeley&#8217;s First Dialogue between Hylas and Philonous, pp.
        145-146 of the same volume.</p>
      <p>
        I subjoin a passage from the work of Professor Bain on
        Psychology, where this difficult subject is carefully analysed
        (The Senses and the Intellect, p. 370). &#8220;There is no possible
        knowledge of the world except in reference to our minds.
        Knowledge means a state of mind: the knowledge of material
        things is a mental thing. We are incapable of discussing the
        existence of an independent material world: the very act is a
        contradiction. We can speak only of a world presented to our own
        minds. By an illusion of language we fancy that we are capable
        of contemplating a world which does not enter into our own
        mental existence: but the attempt belies itself, for this
        contemplation is an effort of mind.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Solidity, extension, space &#8212; the foundation properties of the
        material world &#8212; mean, as has been said above, certain movements
        and energies of our own bodies, and exist in our minds in the
        shape of feelings of force, allied with visible and tactile, and
        other sensible impressions. The sense of the external is the
        consciousness of particular energies and activities of our own.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        (P. 376). &#8220;We seem to have no better way of assuring ourselves
        and all mankind, that with the conscious movement of opening the
        eyes there will always be a consciousness of light, than by
        saying that the light exists as an independent fact, without any
        eyes to see it. But if we consider the fact fairly we shall see
        that this assertion errs, not simply in being beyond any
        evidence that we can have, but also in being a
        self-contradiction. We are affirming <i>that</i> to have an
        existence out of our minds, which we cannot know but as in our
        minds. In words we assert independent existence, while in the
        very act of doing so we contradict ourselves. Even a possible
        world implies a possible mind to conceive it, just as much as an
        actual world implies an actual mind. The mistake of the common
        modes of expression on this matter is the mistake of supposing
        the abstractions of the mind to have a separate and independent
        existence. Instead of looking upon the doctrine of an external
        and independent world as a generalisation or abstraction
        grounded on our particular experiences, summing up the past and
        predicting the future, we have got into the way of maintaining
        the abstraction to be an independent reality, the foundation, or
        cause, or origin, of all these experiences.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        To the same purpose Mr. Mansel remarks in his Bampton Lectures
        on &#8220;The Limits of Religious Thought,&#8221; page 52:</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;A second characteristic of Consciousness is, that it is only
        possible in the form of a <i>relation</i>. There must be a
        Subject or person conscious, and an Object or thing of which he
        is conscious. There can be no consciousness without the union of
        these two factors; and in that union each exists only as it is
        related to the other. The subject is a subject only in so far as
        it is conscious of an object: the object is an object only in so
        far as it is apprehended by a subject: and the destruction of
        either is the destruction of consciousness itself. It is thus
        manifest that a consciousness of the Absolute is equally
        self-contradictory with that of the Infinite.&#8230; Our whole notion
        of Existence is necessarily relative, for it is existence as
        conceived by us. But <i>Existence</i>, as we conceive it, is
        but a name for the several ways in which objects are presented
        to our consciousness &#8212; a general term embracing a variety of
        relations.&#8230; To assume Absolute Existence as an object of thought
        is thus to suppose a relation existing when the related terms
        exist no longer. An object of thought exists, as such, in and
        through its relation to a thinker; while the Absolute, as such,
        is independent of all relation.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Dr. Henry More has also a passage asserting the essential
        correlation on which I am here insisting (Immortality of the
        Soul, ch. ii. p. 3). And Professor Ferrier, in his Institutes of
        Metaphysic, has given much valuable elucidation respecting the
        essential relativity of cognition.</p>
      <p>
        Though this note is already long, I shall venture to add from an
        eminent German critic &#8212; Trendelenburg &#8212; a passage which goes to
        the same point.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Das Sein ist als die absolute Position erkl&auml;rt worden. Der
        Begriff des Seins dr&uuml;cke blos das aus: es werde bei dem
        einfachen Setzen eines <i>Was</i> sein Bewenden haben. Es hat
        sich hier die abstracte Vorstellung des Seins nur in eine
        verwandte Anschauung umgekleidet; denn das Gesetzte steht in dem
        Raum da; und insofern fordert die absolute Position schon den
        Begriff des seiendem Etwas, das gesetzt wird. <i>Fragt man
          weiter, so ist in der absoluten Position schon derjenige
          mitgedacht, der da setzt.</i> Das Sein wird also <i>nicht
          unabh&auml;ngig aus sich selbst bestimmt</i>, sondern zur
        Erkl&auml;rung <i>ein Verh&auml;ltniss zu der Th&auml;tigkeit
          des Gedankens herbeigezogen</i>.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Aehnlich w&uuml;rde jede von vorn herein versuchte Bestimmung
        des Denkens ausfallen. Man w&uuml;rde es nur durch einen Bezug
        zu den Dingen erl&auml;utern k&ouml;nnen, welche in dem Denken
        Grund und Mass finden. Wir begeben uns daher jeder
        Erkl&auml;rung, und setzen eine Vorstellung des Denkens und
        Seins voraus, in der Hoffnung dass beide mit jedem Schritt der
        Untersuchung sich in sich selbst bestimmen werden.&#8221; &#8220;Indem wir
        Denken und Sein unterscheiden, fragen wir, wie ist es
        m&ouml;glich, dass sich im Erkennen Denken und Sein vereinigt? <i>Diese
          Vereinigung sprechen wir vorl&auml;ufig als eine Thatsache
          aus, die das Theoretische wie das Praktische beherrscht.</i>&#8221;

        Either without the other, impossible. Plato admits this in
        Sophistes.</span></p>
    <p>
      I cannot therefore agree with Plato in regarding the Protagorean
      doctrine &#8212; Homo Mensura &#8212; as having any dependance upon, or any
      necessary connection with, the other theory (canvassed in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus) which pronounces cognition to be sensible
      perception. Objects of thought exist in relation to a thinking
      Subject; as Objects of sight or touch exist in relation to a
      seeing or touching Subject. And this we shall find Plato himself
      declaring in the Sophistes (where his Eleatic disputant is
      introduced as impugning a doctrine substantially the same as that
      of Plato himself in the Ph&aelig;don, Tim&aelig;us, and elsewhere)
      as well as here in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. In the Sophistes,
      certain philosophers (called the Friends of Forms or Ideas) are
      noticed, who admitted that all sensible or perceivable existence
      (&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; Fientia) was relative to a (capable) sentient or
      percipient &#8212; but denied the relativity of Ideas, and maintained
      that Ideas, Concepts, Intelligible Entia, were not relative but
      absolute. The Eleate combats these philosophers, and establishes
      against them &#8212; That the Cogitable or Intelligible existence, Ens
      Rationis, was just as much relative to an Intelligent or Cogitant
      subject, as perceivable existence was relative to a Subject
      capable of perceiving &#8212; That Existence, under both varieties, was
      nothing more than a potentiality, correlating with a
      counter-potentiality <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page126"

      <p>
        The view taken of this matter by Mr. John Stuart Mill, in the
        third chapter of the first Book of his System of Logic, is very
        instructive; see especially pp. 65-66 (ed. 4th).</p>
      <p>
        Aristippus (one of the Sokratici viri, contemporary of Plato)
        and the Kyrenaic sect affirmed the doctrine &#8212; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#945; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#951;
        &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#960;&#964;&#940;. Aristokles refutes them by saying that there can be
        no &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962; without both Object and Subject &#8212; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957; and &#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#959;&#957;.
        And he goes on to declare that these three are of necessary
        co-existence or consubstantiality. &#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#956;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#947;&#949; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;

        (ap. Eusebium, Pr&aelig;p. Ev. xiv. 19, 1).</p>
      <p>
        I apprehend that Aristokles by these words does not really
        refute what Aristippus meant to affirm. Aristippus meant to
        affirm the Relative, and to decline affirming anything beyond;
        and in this Aristokles agrees, making the doctrine even more
        comprehensive by showing that Object as well as Subject are
        relative also; implicated both with each other and in the &#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_28_14"></a>Plato&#8217;s representation of the
        Protagorean doctrine in intimate conjunction with the
        Herakleitean.</span></p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of the Eleate in the Platonic Sophistes coincides
      with the Protagorean &#8212; <i>Homo Mensura</i> &#8212; construed in its
      true meaning: Object is implicated with, limited or measured by,
      Subject: a doctrine proclaiming the relativeness of all objects
      perceived, conceived, known, or felt &#8212; and the omnipresent
      involution of the perceiving, conceiving, knowing, or feeling,
      Subject: the object varying with the Subject. &#8220;As things appear to
      me, so they are to me: as they appear to you, so they are to you.&#8221;
      This theory is just and important, if rightly understood and
      explained: but whether Protagoras did so explain or understand it,
      we cannot say; nor does the language of Plato enable us to make
      out. Plato passes on from this theory to another, which he
      supposes Protagoras to have held without distinctly stating it:
      That there is no Ens distinguishable in itself or permanent, or
      stationary: that all existences are in perpetual flux, motion,
      change &#8212; acting and reacting upon each other, combining with or
      disjoining from each other.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_28"

        Though Plato states the grounds of this theory in his ironical
        way, as if it were an absurd fancy, yet it accidentally
        coincides with the largest views of modern physical science.
        Absolute rest is unknown in nature: all matter is in perpetual

      Turning to the special theory of Protagoras (Homo Mensura), and
      producing arguments, serious or ironical in its defence, Sokrates
      says &#8212; What you call colour has no definite place or existence
      either within you or without you. It is the result of the passing
      collision between your eyes and the flux of things suited to act
      upon them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page127"

      passing between the two. It will vary with the subject: it is not
      the same to you, to another man, to a dog or horse, or even to
      yourself at different times. The object measured or touched cannot
      be in itself either great, or white, or hot: for if it were, it
      would not appear different to another Subject. Nor can the Subject
      touching or measuring be in itself great, or white, or hot: for if
      so, it would always be so, and would not be differently modified
      when applied to a different object. <i>Great</i>, <i>white</i>,
      <i>hot</i>, denote no positive and permanent attribute either in
      Object or Subject, but a passing result or impression generated
      between the two, relative to both and variable with either.<a

      To illustrate this farther (continues Sokrates) &#8212; suppose we have
      here six dice. If I compare them with three other dice placed by
      the side of them, I shall call the six dice <i>more</i> and <i>double</i>:
      if I put twelve other dice by the side of them, I shall call the
      six <i>fewer</i> and <i>half</i>. Or take an old man &#8212; and put a
      growing youth by his side. Two years ago the old man was taller
      than the youth: now, the youth is grown, so that the old man is
      the shorter of the two. But the old man, and the six dice, have
      remained all the time unaltered, and equal to themselves. How then
      can either of them become either greater or less? or how can
      either <i>really be</i> so, when they were not so before?<a

        described.</span></p>
    <p>
      The illustration here furnished by Sokrates brings out forcibly
      the negation of the absolute, and the affirmation of universal
      relativity in all conceptions, judgments, and predications, which
      he ascribes to Protagoras and Herakleitus. The predication
      respecting the six dice denotes nothing real, independent,
      absolute, inhering in them: for they have undergone no change. It
      is relative, and expresses a mental comparison made by me or some
      one else. It is therefore relative in two different senses:&#8212; 1. To
      some other object with which the comparison of the dice is <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page128" id="v3page128"></a>128</span>made:&#8212;
      2. To me as comparing Subject, who determine the objects with
      which the comparison shall be made.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_31"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> &#8212; Though
      relativity in both senses is comprehended by the Protagorean
      affirmation &#8212; Homo Mensura &#8212; yet relativity in the latter sense is
      all which that affirmation essentially requires. And this is true
      of all propositions, comparative or not &#8212; whether there be or be
      not reference to any other object beyond that which is directly
      denoted. But Plato was here illustrating the larger doctrine which
      he ascribes to Protagoras in common with Herakleitus: and
      therefore the more complicated case of relativity might suit his
      purpose better.</p>

        The Aristotelian Category of Relation (&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#943;, Categor. p.
        6, a. 36) designates one object apprehended and named relatively
        to some other object &#8212; as distinguished from object apprehended
        and named not thus relatively, which Aristotle considers as <i>per
          se</i> &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#972; (Ethica Nikomach. i. p. 1096, a. 21).
        Aristotle omits or excludes relativity of the object apprehended
        to the percipient or concipient subject, which is the sort of
        relativity directly noted by the Protagorean doctrine. </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally Aristotle passes from relativity in the former
        sense to relativity in the latter; as when he discusses
        &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; and &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, alluded to in one of my former <a
          href="#Footnotev3_28_21">notes</a> on this dialogue. But he
        seems unconscious of any transition. In the Categories, Object,
        as implicated with Subject does not seem to have been distinctly
        present to his reflection. In the third book of the Metaphysica,
        indeed, he discusses professedly the opinion of Protagoras; and
        among his objections against it, one is, that it makes
        everything relative or &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#943; (Metaph. &#915;. p. 1011, a. 20, b.
        5). This is hardly true in the sense which &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#943; bears as one
        of his Categories: but it is true in the other sense to which I
        have adverted.</p>
      <p>
        A clear and full exposition of what is meant by the Relativity
        of Human Knowledge, will be found in Mr. John Stuart Mill&#8217;s most
        recent work, &#8216;Examination of Sir William Hamilton&#8217;s Philosophy,&#8217;
        ch. ii. pp. 6-15.</p>

    <p>
      Sokrates now re-states that larger doctrine, in general terms, as
      follows.</p>

    <p>
      The universe is all flux or motion, divided into two immense
      concurrent streams of force, one active, the other passive;
      adapted one to the other, but each including many varieties. One
      of these is Object: the other is, sentient, cognizant, concipient,
      Subject. Object as well as Subject is, in itself and separately,
      indeterminate and unintelligible &#8212; a mere chaotic Agent or
      Patient. It is only by copulation and friction with each other
      that they generate any definite or intelligible result. Every such
      copulation, between parts adapted to each other, generates a twin
      offspring: two correlative and inseparable results infinitely
      diversified, but always born in appropriate pairs:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_32" href="#Footnotev3_28_32"><span
          class="sp">32</span></a> a <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page129" id="v3page129"></a>129</span>definite
      perception or feeling, on the subjective side &#8212; a definite thing
      perceived or felt, on the objective. There cannot be one of these
      without the other: there can be no objective manifestation without
      its subjective correlate, nor any subjective without its
      objective. This is true not merely about the external senses &#8212;
      touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing &#8212; but also about the internal,
      &#8212; hot and cold, pleasure and pain, desire, fear, and all the
      countless variety of our feelings which have no separate names.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_33" href="#Footnotev3_28_33"><span
          class="sp">33</span></a> Each of these varieties of feeling
      has its own object co-existent and correlating with it. Sight,
      hearing, and smell, move and generate rapidly and from afar; touch
      and taste, slowly and only from immediate vicinity: but the
      principle is the same in all. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, when the visual
      power of the eye comes into reciprocal action with its appropriate
      objective agent, the result between them is, that the visual power
      passes out of its abstract and indeterminate state into a concrete
      and particular act of vision &#8212; the seeing a white stone or wood:
      while the objective force also passes out of its abstract and
      indeterminate state into concrete &#8212; so that it is no longer
      whiteness, but a piece of white stone or wood actually seen.<a

      Accordingly, nothing can be affirmed to exist separately and by

        In this passage I follow Heindorf&rsquo;s explanation which seems

        does really mean here the <i>generic</i> aggregates. He had
        before talked about sights, sounds, hot, cold, hard, &amp;c.,
        the separate sensations. He may perhaps here mean simply
        individual things as aggregates or &#7936;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#943;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#8212; a <i>man</i>, a

    <p>
      The arguments advanced against this doctrine from the phenomena of
      dreams, distempers, or insanity, admit (continues Sokrates) of a
      satisfactory answer. A man who is dreaming, sick, or mad, believes
      in realities different from, and inconsistent with, those which he
      would believe in when healthy. But this is because he is, under
      those peculiar circumstances, a different Subject, unlike what he
      was before. One of the two factors of the result being thus
      changed, the result itself is changed.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_40"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> The
      cardinal principle of Protagoras &#8212; the essential correlation, and
      indefeasible fusion, of Subject and Object, exhibits itself in a
      perpetual series of definite manifestations. To say that I (the
      Subject) perceive, &#8212; is to say that I perceive some Object: to
      perceive and perceive nothing, is a contradiction. Again, if an
      Object be sweet, it must be sweet to some percipient Subject:
      sweet, but sweet to no one, is impossible.<a

        doctrine, as given here by Sokrates is to a great degree just.
        You cannot explain the facts of consciousness by independent
        Subject and Object.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such is the exposition which Sokrates is here made to give, of the
      Protagorean doctrine. How far the arguments, urged by him in its
      behalf, are such as Protagoras himself either really urged, or
      would have adopted, we cannot say. In so far as the doctrine
      asserts essential fusion and implication between Subject and
      Object, with actual multiplicity of distinct Subjects &#8212; denying
      the reality either of absolute and separate Subject, or of
      absolute and separate Object<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_43"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> &#8212; I
      think it true and instructive. We are reminded that when we affirm
      any thing about an Object, there is always (either expressed or
      tacitly implied) a Subject or Subjects (one, many, or all), <i>to
        whom</i> the Object <i>is</i> what it is declared to be. This
      is the fundamental characteristic of consciousness, feeling, and
      cognition, in all their actual varieties. All of them are bi-polar
      or bi-lateral, admitting of being looked at either on <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page132" id="v3page132"></a>132</span>the
      subjective or on the objective side. Comparisons and contrasts,
      gradually multiplied, between one consciousness and another, lead
      us to distinguish the one of these points of view from the other.
      In some cases, the objective view is brought into light and
      prominence, and the subjective thrown into the dark and put out of
      sight: in other cases, the converse operation takes place.
      Sometimes the Ego or Subject is prominent, sometimes the Mecum or
      Object.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_44" href="#Footnotev3_28_44"><span
          class="sp">44</span></a> Sometimes the Objective is as it were
      divorced from the Subject, and projected outwards, so as to have
      an illusory appearance of existing apart from and independently of
      any Subject. In other cases, the subjective view is so exclusively
      lighted up and conspicuous, that Object disappears, and we talk of
      a mind conceiving, as if it had no correlative Concept. It is
      possible, by abstraction, to indicate, to <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page133" id="v3page133"></a>133</span>name, and to
      reason about, the one of these two points of view without
      including direct notice of the other: this is abstraction or
      logical separation &#8212; a mental process useful and largely
      applicable, yet often liable to be mistaken for real distinctness
      and duality. In the present case, the two abstractions become
      separately so familiar to the mind, that this supposed duality is
      conceived as the primordial and fundamental fact: the actual,
      bilateral, consciousness being represented as a temporary
      derivative state, generated by the copulation of two factors
      essentially independent of each other. Such a theory, however,
      while aiming at an impracticable result, amounts only to an
      inversion of the truth. It aims at explaining our consciousness as
      a whole; whereas all that we can really accomplish, is to explain,
      up to a certain point, the conditions of conjunction and sequence
      between different portions of our consciousness. It also puts the
      primordial in the place of the derivative, and transfers the
      derivative to the privilege of the primordial. It attempts to find
      a generation for what is really primordial &#8212; the total series of
      our manifold acts of consciousness, each of a bilateral character,
      subjective on one side and objective on the other: and it assigns
      as the generating factors two concepts obtained by abstraction
      from these very acts, &#8212; resulting from multiplied comparisons, &#8212;
      and ultimately exaggerated into an illusion which treats the
      logical separation as if it were bisection in fact and reality.</p>

        Aristotle, in a passage of the treatise De Anim&acirc; (iii. 1,
        2-4-7-8, ed. Trendelenburg, p. 425, b. 25, p. 426, a. 15-25,
        Bekk.), impugns an opinion of certain antecedent &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953; whom
        he does not specify; which opinion seems identical with the
        doctrine of Protagoras. These philosophers said, that &#8220;there was
        neither white nor black without vision, nor savour without the
        sense of taste&#8221;. Aristotle says that they were partly right,
        partly wrong. They were right in regard to the actual, wrong in
        regard to the potential. The actual manifestation of the
        perceived is one and the same with that of the percipient,
        though the two are not the same logically in the view of the
        reflecting mind (&#7969; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#7969;

        is not true when we speak of them potentially &#8212; &#948;&#953;&#967;&#8182;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961;
        &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957;

      <p>
        I think that the distinction, which Aristotle insists upon as a
        confutation of these philosophers, is not well founded. What he
        states, in very just language, about <i>actual perception</i>
        is equally true about <i>potential perception</i>. As the
        present fact of actual perception implicates essentially a
        determinate percipient subject with a determinate perceived
        object, and admits of being looked at either from the one point
        of view or from the other &#8212; so the concept of potential
        perception implicates in like manner an indeterminate
        perceivable with an indeterminate subject competent to perceive.
        The perceivable or cogitable has no meaning except in relation
        to some Capax Percipiendi or Capax Cogitandi.</p>

        The terms Ego and Mecum, to express the antithesis of these two
        &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8048;, are used by Professor Ferrier in his very
        acute treatise, the Institutes of Metaphysic, pp. 93-96. The
        same antithesis is otherwise expressed by various modern writers
        in the terms Ego and non-Ego &#8212; le moi et le non-moi. I cannot
        think that this last is the proper way of expressing it. You do
        not want to negative the Ego, but to declare its essential
        implication with a variable correlate; to point out the
        bilateral character of the act of consciousness. The two are not
        merely <i>Relata secundum dici</i> but <i>Relata secundum esse</i>,
        to use a distinction recognised in the scholastic logic. </p>

        The implication of Subject and Object is expressed in a peculiar
        manner (though still clearly) by Aristotle in the treatise De
        Anim&acirc;, iii. 8, 1, 431, b. 21. &#7969; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8052; &#964;&#8048; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945; <span

        &#960;&#969;&#962; (&#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#940;, as Simplikius explains it, fol. 78, b. 1) here
        deserves attention. &#8220;The soul is all existing things <i>in a
          certain way</i> (or looked at under a certain aspect). All
        things are either Percepta or Cogitata: now Cognition is in a
        certain sense the Cognita &#8212; Perception is the Percepta.&#8221; He goes
        on to say that the Percipient Mind is the Form of Percepta,
        while the matter of Percepta is without: but that the Cogitant
        Mind is identical with Cogitata, for they have no matter (iii.
        4, 12, p. 430, a. 3, with the commentary of Simplikius p. 78, b.
        17, f. 19, a. 12). This is in other words the Protagorean
        doctrine &#8212; That the mind is the measure of all existences; and
        that this is even more true about &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8048; than about &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;. That
        doctrine is completely independent of the theory, that &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;
        is &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;.</p>
      <p>
        It is in conformity with this affirmation of Aristotle
        (partially approved even by Cudworth &#8212; see Mosheim&#8217;s Transl. of
        Intell. Syst. Vol. II. ch. viii. pp. 27-28) &#8212; &#7969; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8052; &#964;&#8048; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#974;&#962;
        &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8212; that Mr. John Stuart Mill makes the following
        striking remark about the number of ultimate Laws of Nature:&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;It is useful to remark, that the ultimate Laws of Nature cannot
        possibly be less numerous than the distinguishable sensations or
        other feelings of our nature: those, I mean, which are
        distinguishable from one another in quality, and not merely in
        quantity or degree. For example, since there is a phenomenon <i>sui
          generis</i> called colour, which our consciousness testifies
        to be not a particular degree of some other phenomenon, as heat,
        or odour, or motion, but intrinsically unlike all others, it
        follows that there are ultimate laws of colour &#8230;The ideal limit
        therefore of the explanation of natural phenomena would be to
        show that each distinguishable variety of our sensations or
        other states of consciousness has only one sort of cause.&#8221;

    <p>
      In Plato&#8217;s exposition of the Protagorean theory, the true doctrine
      held by Protagoras,<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_45"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> and the
      illusory explanation (whether belonging to him or to Plato
      himself), are singularly blended together. He denies expressly <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page134" id="v3page134"></a>134</span>all
      separate existence either of Subject or Object &#8212; all possibility
      of conceiving or describing the one as a reality distinct from the
      other. He thus acknowledges consciousness and cognition as
      essentially bilateral. Nevertheless he also tries to explain the
      generation of these acts of consciousness, by the hypothesis of a
      <i>latens processus</i> behind them and anterior to them &#8212; two
      continuous moving forces, agent and patient, originally distinct,
      conspiring as joint factors to a succession of compound results.
      But when we examine the language in which Plato describes these
      forces, we see that he conceives them only as Abstractions and
      Potentialities;<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_46" href="#Footnotev3_28_46"><span
          class="sp">46</span></a> though he ascribes to them a
      metaphorical copulation and generation. &#8220;Every thing is motion (or
      change): of which there are two sorts, each infinitely manifold:
      one, having power to act &#8212; the other having power to suffer.&#8221; Here
      instead of a number of distinct facts of consciousness, each
      bilateral &#8212; we find ourselves translated by abstraction into a
      general potentiality of consciousness, also essentially bilateral
      and multiple. But we ought to recollect, that the Potential is
      only a concept abstracted from the actual, &#8212; and differing from it
      in this respect, that it includes what has been and what may be,
      as well as what is. But it is nothing new and distinct by itself:
      it cannot be produced as a substantive antecedent to the actual,
      and as if it afforded explanation thereof. The general proposition
      about motion or change (above cited in the words of Plato), as far
      as it purports to get behind the fact of consciousness and to
      assign its cause or antecedent &#8212; is illusory. But if considered as
      a general expression for that fact itself, in the most
      comprehensive terms &#8212; indicating the continuous thread of
      separate, ever-changing acts of consciousness, each essentially
      bilateral, or subjective as well <span class="pagenum"><a

        The elaborate Dissertation of Sir William Hamilton, on the
        Philosophy of the Unconditioned (standing first in his
        &#8216;Discussions on Philosophy&#8217;), is a valuable contribution to
        metaphysical philosophy. He affirms and shows, &#8220;That the
        Unconditioned is incognisable and inconceivable: its notion
        being only a negation of the Conditioned, which last can alone
        be positively known and conceived&#8221; (p. 12); refuting the
        opposite doctrine as proclaimed, with different modifications,
        both by Schelling and Cousin. </p>
      <p>
        In an Appendix to this Dissertation, contained in the same
        volume (p. 608), Sir W. Hamilton not only re-asserts the
        doctrine (&#8220;Our whole knowledge of mind and matter is relative,
        conditioned &#8212; relatively conditioned. Of things absolutely or in
        themselves, be they external, be they internal, we know nothing,
        or know them only as incognisable,&#8221; &amp;c.) &#8212; but affirms
        farther that philosophers of every school, with the exception of
        a few late absolute theorisers in Germany, have always held and
        harmoniously re-echoed the same doctrine.</p>
      <p>
        In proof of such unanimous agreement, he cites passages from
        seventeen different philosophers.</p>
      <p>
        The first name on his list stands as follows:&#8212; &#8220;1. Protagoras &#8212;
        (as reported by Plato, Aristotle, Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes
        Laertius, &amp;c.) &#8212; Man is (for himself) the measure of all
        things&#8221;.</p>
      <p>
        Sir William Hamilton understands the Protagorean doctrine as I
        understand it, and as I have endeavoured to represent it in the
        present chapter. It has been very generally misconceived.</p>
      <p>
        I cannot, however, agree with Sir William Hamilton, in thinking
        that this theory respecting the Unconditioned and the Absolute,
        has been the theory generally adopted by philosophers. The
        passages which he cites from other authors are altogether
        insufficient to prove such an affirmation.</p>

        In that distinction, upon which Aristotle lays so much stress,
        between Actus and Potentia, he declares Actus or actuality to be
        the Prius &#8212; Potentia or potentiality to be the Posterius. See
        Metaphysica, &#920;. 8, 1049, b. 5 seqq.; De Anim&acirc;, ii. 4, 415,
        a. 17. The Potential is a derivative from the Actual &#8212; derived
        by comparison, abstraction, and logical analysis: a Mental
        concept, helping us to describe, arrange, and reason about, the
        multifarious acts of sense or consciousness &#8212; but not an
        anterior generating reality. </p>

        Turgot observes (&#338;uvres, vol. iii. pp. 108-110; Article in the
        Encyclop&eacute;die, <i>Existence</i>):&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Le premier fondement de la notion de l&#8217;<i>existence</i> est la
        conscience de notre propre sensation, et le sentiment du <i>moi</i>
        qui r&eacute;sulte de cette conscience. La relation
        n&eacute;cessaire entre l&#8217;&ecirc;tre appercevant, et
        l&#8217;&ecirc;tre apper&ccedil;u consid&eacute;r&eacute; hors du <i>moi</i>,
        suppose dans les deux termes la m&ecirc;me
        r&eacute;alit&eacute;. Il y a dans l&#8217;un et dans l&#8217;autre un
        fondement de cette relation, que l&#8217;homme, s&#8217;il avoit un langage,
        pourroit d&eacute;signer par le nom commun d&#8217;<i>existence</i> ou
        de <i>pr&eacute;sence</i>: car ces deux notions ne seroient
        point encore distingu&eacute;es l&#8217;une de l&#8217;autre.&#8230; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Mais il est tr&egrave;s-important d&#8217;observer que ni la simple
        sensation des objets pr&eacute;sens, ni la peinture que fait
        l&#8217;imagination des objets absens, ni le simple rapport de
        distance ou d&#8217;activit&eacute; r&eacute;ciproque, commun aux uns
        et aux autres, ne sont pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment la chose que
        l&#8217;esprit voudroit d&eacute;signer par le nom
        g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d&#8217;<i>existence</i>; c&#8217;est le fondement
        m&ecirc;me de ces rapports, suppos&eacute; commun au <i>moi</i>,
        &agrave; l&#8217;objet vu et &agrave; l&#8217;objet simplement distant, sur
        lequel tombe v&eacute;ritablement et le nom d&#8217;<i>existence</i>
        et notre affirmation, lorsque nous disons qu&#8217;une chose <i>existe</i>.
        Ce fondement n&#8217;est ni ne peut &ecirc;tre connu
        imm&eacute;diatement, et ne nous est indiqu&eacute; que par les
        rapports diff&eacute;rents qui le supposent: nous nous en
        formons cependant une esp&egrave;ce d&#8217;id&eacute;e que nous
        tirons par voie d&#8217;abstraction du t&eacute;moignage que la
        conscience nous rend de nous-m&ecirc;mes et de notre sensation
        actuelle: c&#8217;est-&agrave;-dire, que nous transportons en quelque
        sorte cette conscience du <i>moi</i> sur les objets
        ext&eacute;rieurs, par une esp&egrave;ce d&#8217;assimilation vague,
        d&eacute;mentie <span class="correction" title="corrected from
          'aussitot'">aussit&ocirc;t</span> par la s&eacute;paration de
        tout ce qui caract&eacute;rise le <i>moi</i>, mais qui ne
        suffit pas moins pour devenir le fondement <i>d&#8217;une abstraction

    <p>
      It is to be remembered, that the doctrine here criticised is
      brought forward by the Platonic Sokrates as a doctrine not his
      own, but held by others; among whom he ranks Protagoras as one. </p>
    <p>
      Having thus set forth in his own language, and as an advocate, the
      doctrine of Protagoras, Sokrates proceeds to impugn it: in his
      usual rambling and desultory way, but with great dramatic charm
      and vivacity. He directs his attacks alternately against the two
      doctrines: 1. <i>Homo Mensura</i>: 2. Cognition is sensible
      perception. </p>
    <p>
      I shall first notice what he advances against <i>Homo Mensura</i>.</p>

        measure.</span></p>
    <p>
      It puts every man (he says) on a par as to wisdom and
      intelligence: and not only every man, but every horse, dog, frog,
      and other animal along with him. Each man is a measure for
      himself: all his judgments and beliefs are true: he is therefore

      The doctrine is contradicted (continues Sokrates) by the common
      opinions of mankind: for no man esteems himself a measure on all
      things. Every one believes that there are some things on which he
      is wiser than his neighbour &#8212; and others on which his neighbour is

      In matters of present and immediate sensation, hot, cold, dry,
      moist, sweet, bitter, &amp;c., Sokrates acknowledges that every
      man must judge <i>for himself</i>, and that what each pronounces
      is true <i>for himself</i>. So too, about honourable or base,
      just or unjust, holy or unholy &#8212; whatever rules any city may lay
      down, are true <i>for itself</i>: no man, no city, &#8212; is wiser
      upon these matters than any other.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_53"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> But in
      regard to what is good, profitable, advantageous, healthy,
      &amp;c., the like cannot be conceded. Here (says Sokrates) one
      man, and one city, is decidedly wiser, and judges more truly, than
      another. We cannot say that the judgment of each is true;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_54" href="#Footnotev3_28_54"><span
          class="sp">54</span></a> or that what every man or every city
      anticipates to promise good or profit, will necessarily realise
      such anticipations. In such cases, not merely present sentiment,
      but future consequences are involved. </p>

      involved, as in hot and cold, sweet and bitter, just and unjust,
      honourable and base, &amp;c., there each is a judge for himself,
      and one man is no better judge than another. But where future
      consequences are to be predicted, the ignorant man is incapable:

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_25"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_25"></a>Plato, when he impugns the doctrine
        of Protagoras, states that doctrine without the qualification
        properly belonging to it. All belief relative to the condition
        of the believing mind.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such are the objections urged by Sokrates against the Protagorean
      doctrine &#8212; <i>Homo Mensura</i>. There may have been perhaps in
      the treatise of Protagoras, which unfortunately we do not possess,
      some reasonings or phrases countenancing the opinions against
      which Plato here directs his objections. But so far as I can
      collect, even from the words of Plato himself when he professes to
      borrow the phraseology of his opponent, I cannot think that
      Protagoras ever delivered the opinion which Plato here refutes &#8212; <i>That
        every opinion of every man is true</i>. The opinion really
      delivered by Protagoras appears to have been<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_59" href="#Footnotev3_28_59"><span
          class="sp">59</span></a> &#8212; <i>That every opinion delivered by
        every man is true, to that man <span class="pagenum"><a
            name="v3page138" id="v3page138"></a>138</span>himself</i>.
      But Plato, when he impugns it, leaves out the final qualification;
      falling unconsciously into the fallacy of passing (as logicians
      say) <i>a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter</i>.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_60" href="#Footnotev3_28_60"><span
          class="sp">60</span></a> The qualification thus omitted by
      Plato forms the characteristic feature of the Protagorean
      doctrine, and is essential to the phraseology founded upon it.
      Protagoras would not declare any proposition to be true
      absolutely, or false absolutely. The phraseology belonging to that
      doctrine is forced upon him by Plato. Truth Absolute there is
      none, according to Protagoras. All truth is and must be truth
      relative to some one or more persons, either actually accepting
      and believing in it, or conceived as potential believers under
      certain circumstances. Moreover since these believers are a
      multitude of individuals, each with his own peculiarities &#8212; so no
      truth can be believed in, except under the peculiar measure of the
      believing individual mind. What a man adopts as true, and what he
      rejects as false, are conditioned alike by this limit: a limit not
      merely different in different individuals, but variable and
      frequently varying in the same individual. You cannot determine a
      dog, or a horse, or a child <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page139" id="v3page139"></a>139</span>to believe in
      the Newtonian astronomy: you could not determine the author of the
      Principia in 1687 to believe what the child Newton had believed in
      1647.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_61" href="#Footnotev3_28_61"><span
          class="sp">61</span></a> To say that what is true to one man,
      is false to another &#8212; that what <i>was</i> true to an individual
      as a child or as a youth, becomes false to him in his advanced
      years, is no real contradiction: though Plato, by omitting the
      qualifying words, presents it as if it were such. In every man&#8217;s
      mind, the beliefs of the past have been modified or reversed, and
      the beliefs of the present are liable to be modified or reversed,
      by subsequent operative causes: by new supervening sensations,
      emotions, intellectual comparisons, authoritative teaching, or
      society, and so forth. </p>

      <p>
        Sextus Empiricus adverts to the doctrines of Protagoras (mainly
        to point out how they are distinguished from those of the
        Sceptical school, to which he himself belongs) in Pyrrhon.
        Hypot. i. sects. 215-219; adv. Mathematicos, vii. s.
        60-64-388-400. He too imputes to Protagoras both the two
        doctrines. 1. That man is the measure of all things: that what
        appears to each person is, <i>to him</i>: that all truth is
        thus relative. 2. That all phantasms, appearances, opinions, are
        <i>true</i>. Sextus reasons at some length (390 seq.) against
        this doctrine No. 2, and reasons very much as Protagoras himself
        would have reasoned, since he appeals to individual sentiment
        and movement of the individual mind (&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#8033;&#963;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;,
        391-400). It appears to me perfectly certain that Protagoras
        advanced the general thesis of Relativity: we see this as well
        from Plato as from Sextus &#8212; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#8212; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
        &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#957; (Steinhart is of opinion that these
        words &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#957; are an addition of Sextus
        himself, and do not describe the doctrine of Protagoras; an
        opinion from which I dissent, and which is contradicted by Plato
        himself: Steinhart, Einleitung, note 8). If Protagoras also
        advanced the doctrine &#8212; all opinions are true &#8212; this was not
        consistent with his cardinal principle of relativity. Either he
        himself did not take care always to enunciate the qualifications
        and limitations which his theory requires, and which in common
        parlance are omitted &#8212; Or his opponents left out the limitations
        which he annexed, and impugned the opinion as if it stood
        without any. This last supposition I think the most probable.</p>
      <p>
        The doctrine of Protagoras is correctly given by Sextus in the
        Pyrrhon. Hypot.</p>

        Aristotle, in commenting on the Protagorean formula, falls into
        a similar inaccuracy in slurring over the restrictive
        qualification annexed by Protagoras. Metaphysic. &#915;. p. 1009, a.

        The argument produced by Plato to discredit the Protagorean
        theory &#8212; that it puts the dog or the horse on a level with man &#8212;

        Mr. James Harris, the learned Aristotelian of the last century,
        remarks, in his Dialogue on Happiness (Works, ed. 1772, pp.
        143-168):&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Every particular Species is, itself to itself, the Measure of
        all things in the Universe. As things vary in their relations to
        it, they vary also in their value. If their value be ever
        doubtful, it can noway be adjusted but by recurring with
        accuracy to the natural State of the Species, and to those
        several Relations which such a State of course creates.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The fact, that all exposition and discussion is nothing more than
      an assemblage of individual judgments, depositions, affirmations,
      negations, &amp;c, is disguised from us by the elliptical form in
      which it is conducted. For example:&#8212; I, who write this book &#8212; can
      give nothing more than my own report, as a witness, of facts known
      to me, and of what has been said, thought, or done by others, &#8212;
      for all which I cite authorities:&#8212; and my own conviction, belief
      or disbelief, as to the true understanding thereof, and the
      conclusions deducible. I produce the reasons which justify my
      opinion: I reply to those reasons which have been supposed by
      others to justify the opposite. It is for the reader to judge how
      far my reasons appear satisfactory to his mind.<a

          name="v3page140" id="v3page140"></a>140</span>own convictions,
      is all that is in my power: and if I spoke with full correctness
      and amplitude, it would be incumbent on me to avoid pronouncing
      any opinion to be <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> simply: I ought to
      say, it is <i>true to me &#8212; or false to me</i>. But to repeat this
      in every other sentence, would be a tiresome egotism. It is
      understood once for all by the title-page of the book: an opponent
      will know what he has to deal with, and will treat the opinions
      accordingly. If any man calls upon me to give him absolute truth,
      and to lay down the canon of evidence for identifying it &#8212; I
      cannot comply with the request, any farther than to deliver my own
      best judgment, what is truth &#8212; and to declare what is the canon of
      evidence which guides my own mind. Each reader must determine for
      himself whether he accepts it or not. I might indeed clothe my own
      judgments in oracular and vehement language: I might proclaim them
      as authoritative dicta: I might speak as representing the Platonic
      Ideal, Typical Man, &#8212; or as inspired by a &#948;&#945;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957; like Sokrates: I
      might denounce opponents as worthless men, deficient in all the
      sentiments which distinguish men from brutes, and meriting
      punishment as well as disgrace. If I used all these harsh phrases,
      I should only imitate what many authors of repute think themselves
      entitled to say, about <span class="smcap">THEIR</span> beliefs
      and convictions. Yet in reality, I should still be proclaiming
      nothing beyond my own feelings:&#8212; the force of emotional
      association, and antipathy towards opponents, which had grown
      round these convictions in my own mind. Whether I speak in
      accordance with others, or in opposition to others, in either case
      I proclaim my own reports, feelings and judgments &#8212; nothing
      farther. I cannot escape from the Protagorean limit or measures.<a

        Sokrates himself states as much as this in the course of his
        reply to the doctrine of Protagoras, The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. 171
        D.: &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;, &#959;&#7990;&#956;&#945;&#953;, &#967;&#961;&#8134;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#8230; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;

        The necessity (&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;) to which Sokrates here adverts, is well
        expressed by M. Deg&eacute;rando. &#8220;En jugeant ce que pensent les

        doctrine equalises all men and animals. How far true. Not true
        in the sense requisite to sustain Plato&#8217;s objection.</span></p>
    <p>
      To this theory Plato imputes as a farther consequence, that it
      equalises all men and all animals. No doubt, the measure or limit
      as generically described, bears alike upon all: but it does not
      mark the same degree in all. Each man&#8217;s bodily efforts are
      measured or limited by the amount of his physical force: this is
      alike true of all men: yet it does not follow that the physical
      force of all men is equal. The dog, the horse, the new-born child,
      the lunatic, is each a measure of truth to himself: the
      philosopher is so also to himself: this is alike true, whatever
      may be the disparity of intelligence: and is rather more obviously
      true when the disparity is great, because the lower intelligence
      has then a very narrow stock of beliefs, and is little modifiable
      by the higher. But though the Protagorean doctrine declares the
      dog or the child to be a measure of truth &#8212; each to himself &#8212; it
      does not declare either of them to be a measure of truth to me, to
      you, or to any ordinary by-stander. How far any person is a
      measure of truth to others, depends upon the estimation in which
      he is held by others: upon the belief which they entertain
      respecting his character or competence. Here is a new element let
      in, of which Plato, in his objection to the Protagorean doctrine,
      takes no account. When he affirms that Protagoras by his
      equalising doctrine acknowledged himself to be no better in point
      of wisdom and judgment than a dog or a child, this inference must
      be denied.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_64" href="#Footnotev3_28_64"><span
          class="sp">64</span></a> The Protagorean doctrine is perfectly
      consistent with great diversities of knowledge, intellect,
      emotion, and character, between one man and another. Such
      diversities are recognised in individual belief and estimation,
      and are thus comprehended in the doctrine. Nor does Protagoras
      deny that men are teachable and modifiable. The scholar after
      being taught <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page142"
          id="v3page142"></a>142</span>will hold beliefs different from
      those which he held before. Protagoras professed to know more than
      others, and to teach them: others on their side also believed that
      he knew more than they, and came to learn it. Such belief on both
      sides, noway contradicts the general doctrine here under
      discussion. What the scholar believes to be true, is still true to
      him: among those things which he believes to be true, one is, that
      the master knows more than he: in coming to be taught, he acts
      upon his own conviction. To say that a man is wise, is to say,
      that he is wise <i>in some one&#8217;s estimation</i>: your own or that
      of some one else. Such estimation is always implied, though often
      omitted in terms. Plato remarks very truly, that every one
      believes some others to be on certain matters wiser than himself.
      In other words, what is called authority &#8212; that predisposition to
      assent, with which we hear the statements and opinions delivered
      by some other persons &#8212; is one of the most operative causes in
      determining human belief. The circumstances of life are such as to
      generate this predisposition in every one&#8217;s mind to a greater or
      less degree, and towards some persons more than towards others.</p>

        believer himself &#8212; The efficacy of authority resides in the
        believer&#8217;s own mind.</span></p>
    <p>
      Belief on authority is true to the believer himself, like all his
      other beliefs, according to the Protagorean doctrine: and in
      acting upon it, &#8212; in following the guidance of A, and not
      following the guidance of B, &#8212; he is still a measure to himself.
      It is not to be supposed that Protagoras ever admitted all men to
      be equally wise, though Plato puts such an admission into his
      mouth as an inference undeniable and obvious. His doctrine affirms
      something altogether different:&#8212; that whether you believe yourself
      to be wise or unwise, in either case the belief is equally your
      own &#8212; equally the result of your own mental condition and
      predisposition, &#8212; equally true to yourself, &#8212; and equally an item
      among the determining conditions of your actions. That the beliefs
      and convictions of one person might be modified by another, was a
      principle held by Protagoras not less than by Sokrates: the former
      employed as his modifying instrument, eloquent lecturing &#8212; the
      latter, dialectical cross-examination. Both of them recognise the
      belief of the person to whom they address themselves as true to
      him, yet at the same time as something which may be modified and
      corrected, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page143"

      Again &#8212; Sokrates imputes it as a contradiction to Protagoras &#8212;
      &#8220;Your doctrine is pronounced to be false by many persons: but you
      admit that the belief of all persons is true: therefore your
      doctrine is false&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_65"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> Here
      also Plato omits the qualification annexed by Protagoras to his
      general principle &#8212; Every man&#8217;s belief is true &#8212; that is, true <i>to
        him</i>. That a belief should be true, to one man, and false to
      another &#8212; is not only no contradiction to the formula of
      Protagoras, but is the very state of things which his formula
      contemplates. He of course could only proclaim it as true to
      himself. It is the express purpose of his doctrine to disallow the
      absolutely true and the absolutely false. His own formula, like
      every other opinion, is false to those who dissent from it: but it
      is not false absolutely, any more than any other doctrine. Plato
      therefore does not make out his charge of contradiction.</p>

      Some men (says Sokrates) have learnt, &#8212; have bestowed study on
      special matters, &#8212; have made themselves wise upon those matters.
      Others have not done the like, but remain ignorant. It is the wise

    <p>
      Upon this we may remark &#8212; First, that even when the untaught men
      are all put aside, and the erudites or Experts remain alone &#8212;
      still these very erudites or Experts, the men of special study,
      are perpetually differing among themselves; so that we cannot
      recognise one as a measure, without repudiating the authority of
      the rest.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_67" href="#Footnotev3_28_67"><span
          class="sp">67</span></a> If by a measure, Plato means an
      infallible measure, he will not find it in this way: he is as far
      from the absolute as before. Next, it is perfectly correct that if
      any man be known to have studied or acquired experience on special
      matters, his opinion obtains an authority with others (more or <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page144" id="v3page144"></a>144</span>fewer),
      such as the opinion of an ignorant man will not possess. This is a
      real difference between the graduated man and the non-graduated.
      But it is a difference not contradicting the theory of Protagoras;
      who did not affirm that every man&#8217;s opinion was equally
      trustworthy in the estimation of others, but that every man&#8217;s
      opinion was alike a measure to the man himself. The authority of
      the guide resides in the belief and opinion of those who follow
      him, or who feel prepared to follow him if necessity arises. A man
      gone astray on his journey, asks the way to his destination from
      residents whom he believes to know it, just as he might look at a
      compass, or at the stars, if no other persons were near. In
      following their direction, he is acting on his own belief, that he
      himself is ignorant on the point in question and that they know.
      He is a measure to himself, both of the extent of his own
      ignorance, and of the extent of his own knowledge. And in this
      respect all are alike &#8212; every man, woman, child, and animal;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_68" href="#Footnotev3_28_68"><span
          class="sp">68</span></a> though they are by no means alike in
      the estimation of others, as trustworthy authorities.</p>

        Plato, The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 171 E. I transcribe the following
        from the treatise of Fichte (Beruf des Menschen, Destination de
        l&#8217;Homme; Traduction de Barchou de Penho&euml;n, ch. i. Le Doute,
        pp. 54-55):&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;De la conscience de chaque individu, la nature se contemplant
        sous un point de vue diff&eacute;rent, il en r&eacute;sulte que
        je m&#8217;appelle <i>moi</i>, et que tu t&#8217;appelles <i>toi</i>. Pour
        toi, je suis hors de toi; et pour moi, tu es hors de moi. Dans
        ce qui est hors de moi, je me saisis d&#8217;abord de ce qui
        m&#8217;avoisine le plus, de ce qui est le plus &agrave; ma
        port&eacute;e: toi, tu fais de m&ecirc;me. Chacun de notre
        c&ocirc;t&eacute;, nous allons ensuite au del&agrave;. Puis,
        ayant commenc&eacute; &agrave; cheminer ainsi dans le monde de
        deux points de d&eacute;part diff&eacute;rens, nous suivons,
        pendant le reste de notre vie, des routes qui se coupent
        &ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave;, mais qui jamais ne suivent
        exactement la m&ecirc;me direction, jamais ne courent
        parall&egrave;lement l&#8217;une &agrave; l&#8217;autre. Tous les individus
        possibles peuvent &ecirc;tre: par cons&eacute;quent aussi, tous
        les points de vue de conscience possibles. <i>La somme de ces
          consciences individuelles fait la conscience universelle: il
          n&#8217;y a pas d&#8217;autre.</i> Ce n&#8217;est en effet que dans l&#8217;individu
        que se trouve &agrave; la fois et la limitation et la
        r&eacute;alit&eacute;. Dans l&#8217;individu la conscience est
        enti&egrave;rement d&eacute;termin&eacute;e par la nature intime
        de l&#8217;individu. Il n&#8217;est donn&eacute; &agrave; personne de savoir
        autre chose que ce qu&#8217;il sait. Il ne pourrait pas davantage
        savoir les m&ecirc;mes choses d&#8217;une autre fa&ccedil;on qu&#8217;il ne
        les sait.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        The same doctrine is enforced with great originality and
        acuteness in a recent work of M. Eug&egrave;ne V&eacute;ron, Du
        Progr&egrave;s Intellectuel dans l&#8217;Humanit&eacute;,
        Sup&eacute;riorit&eacute; des Arts Modernes sur les Arts Anciens
        (Paris, 1862, Guillaumin). M. V&eacute;ron applies his general
        doctrine mainly to the theory of Art and &AElig;sthetics:
        moreover he affirms more than I admit respecting human progress
        as a certain and constant matter of fact. But he states clearly,
        as an universal truth, the relative point of view &#8212; the
        necessary measurement for itself, of each individual mind &#8212; and
        the consequent obligation, on each, to allow to other minds the
        like liberty. We read, pp. 14-16-17:&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Cela revient &agrave; dire que dans quelque cas que nous
        supposions, nous ne pouvons sentir que dans la mesure de notre
        sensibilit&eacute;, comprendre et juger que dans la mesure de
        notre intelligence; et que nos facult&eacute;s &eacute;tant en
        perpetuel developpement, les variations de notre
        personnalit&eacute; entrainent n&eacute;cessairement celles de
        nos jugemens, m&ecirc;me quand nous n&#8217;en avons pas conscience.&#8230;
        Chaque homme a son esprit particulier. Ce que l&#8217;un comprend sans
        peine, un autre ne le peut saisir; ce qui r&eacute;pugne
        &agrave; l&#8217;un, plait &agrave; l&#8217;autre: ce qui ce me parait
        odieux, mon voisin l&#8217;approuve. Quelque bonne envie que nous
        semblions avoir de nous perdre dans la foule, de
        d&eacute;pouiller notre individualit&eacute; pour emprunter des
        jugemens tout faits et des opinions taill&eacute;es &agrave; la
        mesure et &agrave; l&#8217;usage du public &#8212; il est facile de voir
        que, tout en ayant l&#8217;air de r&eacute;p&eacute;ter la
        le&ccedil;on apprise, nous jugeons &agrave; notre
        mani&egrave;re, quand nous jugeons: que notre jugement, tout en
        paraissant &ecirc;tre celui de tout le monde, n&#8217;en reste pas
        moins personnel, et n&#8217;est pas une simple imitation: que cette
        ressemblance m&ecirc;me est souvent plus apparente que
        r&eacute;elle: que l&#8217;identit&eacute; ext&eacute;rieure des
        formules et des expressions ne prouve pas absolument celle de la
        pens&eacute;e. Rien n&#8217;est &eacute;lastique comme les mots, et
        comme les principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux dans lesquels on
        pense enfermer les intelligences. C&#8217;est souvent quand le langage
        est le plus semblable qu&#8217;on est le plus loin de s&#8217;entendre.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Du reste, quand m&ecirc;me cette ressemblance serait aussi
        r&eacute;elle qu&#8217;elle est fausse, en quoi prouverait-il
        l&#8217;identit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire des intelligences? Qu&#8217;y
        aurait-il d&#8217;&eacute;tonnant qu&#8217;au milieu de ce communisme
        intellectual qui r&eacute;git l&#8217;&eacute;ducation de chaque
        classe, et d&eacute;termine nos habitudes intellectuelles et
        morales, les distinctions natives disparussent ou
        s&#8217;att&eacute;nuassent? Ne faut-il pas plut&ocirc;t admirer
        l&#8217;opini&acirc;tre vitalit&eacute; des diff&eacute;rences
        originelles qui r&eacute;sistent &agrave; tant de causes de
        nivellement? L&#8217;identit&eacute; primitive des intelligences n&#8217;est
        qu&#8217;une fiction logique sans r&eacute;alit&eacute; &#8212; une simple
        abstraction de langage, <i>qui ne repose que sur
          l&#8217;identit&eacute; du mot avec lui-m&ecirc;me</i>. Tout se

        circonstances diff&eacute;rentes: c&#8217;est &agrave; dire, que

        distinction between present sensation and anticipation of the
        future.</span></p>
    <p>
      A similar remark may be made as to Plato&#8217;s distinction between the
      different matters to which belief may apply: present sensation or
      sentiment in one case &#8212; anticipation of future sensations or
      sentiments, in another. Upon matters of present sensation and
      sentiment (he argues), such as hot or cold, sweet or bitter, just
      or unjust, honourable or base, &amp;c., one man is as good a judge
      as another: but upon matters involving future contingency, such as
      what is healthy or unhealthy, &#8212; profitable and good, or hurtful
      and bad, &#8212; most men judge badly: only a few persons, possessed of
      special skill and knowledge, judge well, each in his respective
      province.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_32"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_32"></a>The formula of Relativity does not
        imply that every man believes himself to be infallible.</span></p>
    <p>
      I for my part admit this distinction to be real and important.
      Most other persons admit the same.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_69"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> In
      acting upon it, I follow out my belief, &#8212; and so do they. This is
      a general fact, respecting the circumstances which determine
      individual belief. Like all other causes of belief, it operates
      relatively to the individual mind, and thus falls under that
      general canon of relativity, which it is the express purpose of
      the Protagorean formula to <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page146" id="v3page146"></a>146</span>affirm. Sokrates
      impugns the formula of relativity, as if it proclaimed every one
      to believe himself more competent to predict the future than any
      other person. But no such assumption is implied in it. To say that
      a man is a measure to himself, is not to say that he is, or, that
      he believes himself to be, omniscient or infallible. A sick man
      may mistake the road towards future health, in many different
      directions. One patient may over-estimate his own knowledge, &#8212;
      that is one way, but only one among several: another may be
      diffident, and may undervalue his own knowledge: a third may
      over-estimate the knowledge of his professional adviser, and thus
      follow an ignorant physician, believing him to be instructed and
      competent: a fourth, instead of consulting a physician, may
      consult a prophet, whom Plato<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_70"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> here
      reckons among the authoritative infallible measures in respect to
      future events: a fifth may (like the rhetor &AElig;lius Aristeides<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_71" href="#Footnotev3_28_71"><span
          class="sp">71</span></a>) disregard the advice of physicians,
      and follow prescriptions enjoined to him in his own dreams,
      believing them to be sent by &AElig;sculapius the Preserving God.
      Each of these persons judges differently about the road to future
      health: but each is alike a measure to himself: the belief of each
      is relative to his own mental condition and predispositions. You,
      or I, may believe that one or other of them is mistaken: but here
      another measure is introduced &#8212; <i>your</i> mind or <i>mine</i>.</p>

        if the Protagorean formula be admitted, dialectic discussion
        would be annulled &#8212; The reverse is true &#8212; Dialectic recognises
        the autonomy of the Individual mind.</span></p>
    <p>
      But the most unfounded among all Plato&#8217;s objections to the
      Protagorean formula, is that in which Sokrates is made to allege,
      that if it be accepted, the work of dialectical discussion is at
      an end: that the Sokratic Elenchus, the reciprocal scrutiny of
      opinions between two dialogists, becomes nugatory &#8212; since every
      man&#8217;s opinions are <i>right</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_72"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a> Instead
      of <i>right</i>, we must add the requisite qualification, here as
      elsewhere, by reading, <i>right to the man himself</i>. Now,
      dealing with <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page147"
          id="v3page147"></a>147</span>Plato&#8217;s affirmation thus
      corrected, we must pronounce not only that it is not true, but
      that the direct reverse of it is true. Dialectical discussion and
      the Sokratic procedure, far from implying the negation of the
      Protagorean formula, involve the unqualified recognition of it.
      Without such recognition the procedure cannot even begin, much
      less advance onward to any result. Dialectic operates altogether
      by question and answer: the questioner takes all his premisses
      from the answers of the respondent, and cannot proceed in any
      direction except that in which the respondent leads him. Appeal is
      always directly made to the affirmative or negative of the
      individual mind, which is thus installed as measure of truth or
      falsehood <i>for itself</i>. The peculiar and characteristic
      excellence of the Sokratic Elenchus consists in thus stimulating
      the interior mental activity of the individual hearer, in
      eliciting from him all the positive elements of the debate, and in
      making him feel a shock when one of his answers contradicts the
      others. Sokrates not only does not profess to make himself a
      measure for the respondent, but expressly disclaims doing so: he
      protests against being considered as a teacher, and avows his own
      entire ignorance. He undertakes only the obstetric process of
      evolving from the respondent mind what already exists in it
      without the means of escape &#8212; and of applying interrogatory tests
      to the answer when produced: if there be nothing in the
      respondent&#8217;s mind, his art is inapplicable. He repudiates all
      appeal to authority, except that of the respondent himself.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_73" href="#Footnotev3_28_73"><span
          class="sp">73</span></a> Accordingly there <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page148" id="v3page148"></a>148</span>is
      neither sense nor fitness in the Sokratic cross-examination,
      unless you assume that each person, to whom it is addressed, is a
      measure of truth and falsehood to himself. Implicitly indeed, this
      is assumed in rhetoric as well as in dialectic: wherever the
      speaker aims at persuading, he adapts his mode of speech to the
      predispositions of the hearer&#8217;s own mind; and he thus recognises
      that mind as a measure for itself. But the Sokratic Dialectic
      embodies the same recognition, and the same essential relativity
      to the hearer&#8217;s mind, more forcibly than any rhetoric. And the
      Platonic Sokrates (in the Ph&aelig;drus) makes it one of his
      objections against orators who addressed multitudes, that they did
      not discriminate either the specialties of different minds, or the
      specialties of discourse applicable to each.<a

        Plato, Gorg. 472, and The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. 161 A, pp. 375, 376.</p>
      <p>
        In this very argument of Sokrates (in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus)
        against the Protagorean theory, we find him unconsciously
        adopting (as I have already remarked) the very language of that
        theory, as a description of his own procedure, p. 171 D. Compare
        with this a remarkable passage in the colloquy of Sokrates with
        Thrasymachus, in Republic, i. 337 C. </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the long and striking contrast between the philosopher
        and the man of the world, which Plato embodies in this dialogue
        (the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, from p. 172 to p. 177), is so far
        from assisting his argument against Protagoras, that it rather
        illustrates the Protagorean point of view. The beliefs and
        judgments of the man of the world are presented as flowing from
        <i>his</i> mental condition and predispositions: those of the
        philosopher, from <i>his</i>. The two are radically
        dissentient: each appears to the other mistaken and misguided.
        Here is nothing to refute Protagoras. Each of the two is a
        measure for himself.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, it will be said; but Plato&#8217;s measure is right, and that of
        the man of the world is wrong. Perhaps <i>I</i> may think so.
        As a measure for myself, I speak and act accordingly. But the
        opponents have not agreed to accept <i>me</i> any more than
        Plato as their judge. The case remains unsettled as before.</p>

    <p>
      Though Sokrates, and Plato so far forth as follower of Sokrates,
      employed a colloquial method based on the fundamental assumption
      of the Protagorean formula &#8212; autonomy of each individual mind &#8212;
      whether they accepted the formula in terms, or not; yet we shall
      find Plato at the end of his career, in his treatise De Legibus,
      constructing an imaginary city upon the attempted deliberate
      exclusion of this formula. We shall find him there monopolising
      all teaching and culture of his citizens from infancy upwards,
      barring out all freedom of speech or writing by a strict
      censorship, and severely punishing dissent from the prescribed
      orthodoxy. But then we shall also find that Plato in that last
      stage of his life &#8212; when he constitutes himself as lawgiver, the
      measure of truth or falsehood for all his citizens &#8212; has at the
      same time discontinued his early commerce with the Sokratic
      Dialectics.</p>

      Protagorean doctrine of Relativity &#8212; <i>Homo Mensura</i> &#8212; first,
      his statement what the doctrine really is, next his strictures
      upon it &#8212; we may see that he ascribes to it consequences which it
      will not fairly carry. He impugns it as if it excluded philosophy
      and argumentative scrutiny: whereas, on the contrary, it is the
      only basis upon which philosophy or &#8220;reasoned truth&#8221; can stand.
      Whoever denies the Protagorean autonomy<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page149" id="v3page149"></a>149</span> of the
      individual judgment, must propound as his counter theory some
      heteronomy, such as he (the denier) approves. If I am not allowed
      to judge of truth and falsehood for myself, who is to judge for
      me? Plato, in the Treatise De Legibus, answers very
      unequivocally:&#8212; assuming to himself that infallibility which I
      have already characterised as the prerogative of King Nomos: &#8220;I,
      the lawgiver, am the judge for all my citizens: you must take my
      word for what is true or false: you shall hear nothing except what
      my censors approve &#8212; and if, nevertheless, any dissenters arise,
      there are stringent penalties in store for them&#8221;. Here is an
      explicit enunciation of the Counter-Proposition,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_75" href="#Footnotev3_28_75"><span
          class="sp">75</span></a> necessary to be maintained by those
      who deny the Protagorean doctrine. If you pronounce a man unfit to
      be the measure of truth for himself, you constitute yourself the
      measure, in his place: either directly as lawgiver &#8212; or by
      nominating censors according to your own judgment. As soon as he
      is declared a lunatic, some other person must be appointed to
      manage his property for him. You can only exchange one individual
      judgment for another. You cannot get out of the region of
      individual judgments, more or fewer in number: the King, the Pope,
      the Priest, the Judges or Censors, the author of some book, or the
      promulgator of such and such doctrine. The infallible measure
      which you undertake to provide, must be found in some person or
      persons &#8212; if it can be found at all: in some person selected by
      yourself &#8212; that is, in the last result, <i>yourself</i>.<a

        Aristotle says (Ethic. Nikomach. x. 1176, a. 15) &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#948;&#8217; &#7952;&#957;

        in the judgment of the wise or virtuous man.&#8221; The ultimate
        appeal is thus acknowledged to be, not to an abstraction, but to
        some one or more individual persons whom Aristotle recognises as
        wise. <i>That</i> is truth which this wise man declares to be
        truth. You cannot escape from the Relative by any twist of

      Yet little as its positive import may seem to be, it clashes with
      various illusions, omissions, and exigencies, incident to the
      ordinary dogmatising process. It substitutes the concrete in place
      of the abstract &#8212; the complete in place of the elliptical. Instead
      of Truth and Falsehood, which present to us the Abstract and
      impersonal as if it stood alone &#8212; the Objective divested of its
      Subject &#8212; we are translated into the real world of beliefs and
      disbeliefs, individual believers and disbelievers: matters
      affirmed or denied by some Subject actual or supposable &#8212; by you,
      by me, by him or them, perhaps by all persons within our
      knowledge. All men agree in the subjective fact, or in the mental
      states called belief and disbelief; but all men do not agree in
      the matters believed and disbelieved, or in what they speak of as
      Truth and Falsehood. No infallible objective mark, no common
      measure, no canon of evidence, recognised by all, has yet been
      found. What is Truth to one man, is not truth, and is often
      Falsehood, to another: that which governs the mind as infallible
      authority in one part of the globe, is treated with indifference
      or contempt elsewhere.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_77"

      case, which the Protagorean formula brings into full view; but
      which most men dislike to recognise, and disguise from themselves
      as well as from others in the common elliptical forms of speech.
      In most instances a believer entirely forgets that his own mind is
      the product of a given time and place, and of a conjunction of
      circumstances always peculiar, amidst the aggregate of mankind &#8212;
      for the most part narrow. He cannot be content (like Protagoras)

        Respecting the grounds and conditions of belief among the
        Hindoos, Sir William Sleeman (Rambles and Recollections of an
        Indian Official, ch. xxvi. vol. i. pp. 226-228) observes as
        follows:&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Every word of this poem (the Ramaen, Ramayana) the people
        assured me was written, if not by the hand of the Deity himself,
        at least by his inspiration, which was the same thing, and it
        must consequently be true. Ninety-nine out of a hundred, among
        the Hindoos, implicitly believe, not only every word of this
        poem, but every word of every poem that has ever been written in
        Sanscrit. If you ask a man whether he really believes any very
        egregious absurdity quoted from these books, he replies with the
        greatest <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in the world, &#8216;Is it not
        written in the book; and how should it be there written if not
        true?&#8217; &#8230; The greater the improbability, the more monstrous and
        preposterous the fiction, the greater is the charm that it has
        over their minds; and the greater their learning in the
        Sanscrit, the more are they under the influence of this charm.
        Believing all to be written by the Deity, or by his
        inspirations, and the men and things of former days to have been
        very different from the men and things of the present day, and
        the heroes of these fables to have been demigods, or people
        endowed with powers far superior to those of the ordinary men of
        their own day, the analogies of nature are never for a moment
        considered; nor do questions of probability, or possibility,
        according to those analogies, ever obtrude to dispel the charm
        with which they are so pleasingly bound. They go on through life
        reading and talking of these monstrous fictions, which shock the
        taste and understanding of other nations, without once
        questioning the truth of one single incident, or hearing it
        questioned. There was a time, and that not very distant, when it
        was the same in England and in every other European nation; and
        there are, I am afraid, some parts of Europe where it is so
        still. But the Hindoo faith, so far as religious questions are
        concerned, is not more capacious or absurd than that of the
        Greeks and Romans in the days of Sokrates and Cicero; the only
        difference is, that among the Hindoos a greater number of the
        questions which interest mankind are brought under the head of
        religion.&#8221;</p>

        This is the objection taken by Schwegler, Prantl, and other
        German thinkers, against the Protagorean doctrine (Prantl,
        Gesch. der Logik, vol. i. p. 12 seq.; Schwegler, Gesch. der
        Philos. im Umriss. s. 11, b. p. 26, ed. 5th). I had transcribed
        from each of these works a passage of some length, but I cannot
        find room for them in this note. </p>
      <p>
        These authors both say, that the Protagorean canon, properly
        understood, is right, but that Protagoras laid it down wrongly.
        They admit the principle of Subjectivity, as an essential aspect
        of the case, in regard to truth; but they say that Protagoras
        was wrong in appealing to individual, empirical, accidental,
        subjectivity of each man at every varying moment, whereas he
        ought to have appealed to an ideal or universal subjectivity.
        &#8220;What ought to be held true, right, good, &amp;c.,&#8221; (says
        Schwegler) &#8220;must be decided doubtless by <i>me</i>, but by <i>me</i>
        so far forth as a rational, and thinking being. Now <i>my</i>
        thinking, <i>my</i> reason, is not something specially
        belonging to me, but something common to all rational beings,
        something universal; so far therefore as I proceed as a rational
        and thinking person, my subjectivity is an universal
        subjectivity. Every thinking person has the consciousness that
        what he regards as right, duty, good, evil, &amp;c., presents
        itself not merely to him as such, but also to every rational
        person, and that, consequently, his judgment possesses the
        character of universality, universal validity: in one word,
        Objectivity.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Here it is explicitly asserted, that wherever a number of
        individual men employ their reason, the specialities of each
        disappear, and they arrive at the same conclusions &#8212; Reason
        being a guide impersonal as well as infallible. And this same
        view is expressed by Prantl in other language, when he reforms
        the Protagorean doctrine by saying, &#8220;Das Denken ist der Mass der
        Dinge&#8221;.</p>
      <p>
        To me this assertion appears so distinctly at variance with
        notorious facts, that I am surprised when I find it advanced by
        learned historians of philosophy, who recount the very facts
        which contradict it. Can it really be necessary to repeat that
        the reason of one man differs most materially from that of
        another &#8212; and the reason of the same person from itself, at
        different times &#8212; in respect of the arguments accepted, the
        authorities obeyed, the conclusions embraced? The impersonal
        Reason is a mere fiction; the universal Reason is an
        abstraction, belonging alike to all particular reasoners,
        consentient or dissentient, sound or unsound, &amp;c. Schwegler
        admits the Protagorean canon only under a reserve which
        nullifies its meaning. To say that the Universal Reason is the
        measure of truth is to assign no measure at all. The Universal
        Reason can only make itself known through an interpreter. The
        interpreters are dissentient; and which of them is to hold the
        privilege of infallibility? Neither Schwegler nor Prantl are
        forward to specify who the interpreter is, who is entitled to
        put dissentients to silence; both of them keep in the safe
        obscurity of an abstraction &#8212; &#8220;Das Denken&#8221; &#8212; the Universal
        Reason. Protagoras recognises in each dissentient an equal right
        to exercise his own reason, and to judge for himself.</p>
      <p>
        In order to show how thoroughly incorrect the language of
        Schwegler and Prantl is, when they talk about the Universal
        Reason as unanimous and unerring, I transcribe from another
        eminent historian of philosophy a description of what philosophy
        has been from ancient times down to the present.</p>

      This state of mind in reference to belief is usual with most men,
      not less at the present day than in the time of Plato and
      Protagoras. It constitutes the natural intolerance prevalent among
      mankind; which each man (speaking generally), in the case of his
      own beliefs, commends and exults in, as a virtue. It flows as a
      natural corollary from the sentiment of belief, though it may be
      corrected by reflection and social sympathy. Hence the doctrine of
      Protagoras &#8212; equal right of private judgment to each man for
      himself &#8212; becomes inevitably unwelcome.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_38"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_38"></a>Aristotle failed in his attempts to
        refute the Protagorean formula &#8212; Every reader of Aristotle will
        claim the right of examining for himself Aristotle&#8217;s canons of
        truth.</span></p>
    <p>
      We are told that Demokritus, as well as Plato and Aristotle, wrote
      against Protagoras. The treatise of Demokritus is lost: but we
      possess what the two latter said against the Protagorean formula.
      In my judgment both <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page153"
          id="v3page153"></a>153</span>failed in refuting it. Each of
      them professed to lay down objective, infallible, criteria of
      truth and falsehood: Democritus on his side, and the other
      dogmatical philosophers, professed to do the same, each in his own
      way &#8212; and each in a different way.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_79"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> Now the
      Protagorean formula neither allows nor disallows any one of these
      proposed objective criteria: but it enunciates the appeal to which
      all of them must be submitted &#8212; the subjective condition of
      satisfying the judgment of each hearer. Its protest is entered
      only when that condition is overleaped, and when the dogmatist
      enacts his canon of belief as imperative, peremptory, binding upon
      all (allgemeing&uuml;ltig) both assentient and dissentient. I am
      grateful to Aristotle for his efforts to lay down objective canons
      in the research of truth; but I claim the right of examining those
      canons for myself, and of judging whether that, which satisfied
      Aristotle, satisfies me also. The same right which I claim for
      myself, I am bound to allow to all others. The general expression
      of this compromise is, the Protagorean formula. No one demands
      more emphatically to be a measure for himself, even when all
      authority is opposed to him, than Sokrates in the Platonic
      Gorgias.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_80" href="#Footnotev3_28_80"><span

        According to Demokritus all sensible perceptions were

        to the diversity of the percipient Subject; but there was an
        objective reality &#8212; minute, solid, invisible atoms, differing in
        figure, position, and movement, and vacuum along with them. Such
        reality was intelligible only by Reason. &#925;&#972;&#956;&#8179; &#947;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#973;, &#957;&#972;&#956;&#8179;

        Porphyry, who apparently cited from it a passage verbatim, which
        citation Eusebius unfortunately has not preserved (Eusebius,
        Pr&aelig;par. Evang. x. 3, 17). One of the speakers in
        Porphyry&#8217;s dialogue (describing a repast at the house of
        Longinus at Athens to celebrate Plato&#8217;s birthday) accused Plato
        of having copied largely from the arguments of Protagoras &#8212; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;

      After thus criticising the formula &#8212; Homo Mensura &#8212; Plato proceeds

      perception&#8221;. He connects that doctrine with the above-mentioned
      formula, by illustrations which exhibit great divergence between
      one percipient Subject and another. He gives us, as examples of
      sensible perception, the case of the wind, cold to one man, not
      cold to another: that of the wine, sweet to a man in health,

      Protagoras may have dwelt upon cases like these, as best

      though the judgments are in reality both equally relative, whether
      two judges pronounce alike, or whether they pronounce differently,
      under the same conditions &#8212; yet where they judge differently, each
      stands forth in his own individuality, and the relativity of the

        Aristotle (Metaphysic. &#915;. p. 1010, a. 25 seq.) in arguing
        against Herakleitus and his followers, who dwelt upon &#964;&#8048; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8048;
        as ever fluctuating and undefinable, urges against them that
        this is not true of <i>all</i> &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;, but only of those in
        the sublunary region of the Kosmos. But this region is (he says)
        only an imperceptibly small part of the entire Kosmos; the
        objects in the vast superlunary or celestial region of the
        Kosmos were far more numerous, and were also eternal and
        unchangeable, in constant and uniform circular rotation.
        Accordingly, if you predicate one or other about &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8048;
        generally, you ought to predicate constancy and unchangeability,
        not flux and variation, since the former predicates are true of
        much the larger proportion of &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;. See the Scholia on the

        Mr. Campbell, in his Preface to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (p.
        lxxxiii.), while comparing the points in the dialogue with
        modern metaphysical views, observes. &#8220;Modern Experimental
        Science is equally distrustful of individual impressions of
        sense, but has found means of measuring the motions by which
        they are caused, through <i>the effect of the same motions upon
          other things besides our senses</i>. When the same wind is
        blowing one of us feels warm and another cold
        (The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 152), but the mercury of the
        thermometer tells the same tale to all. And though the
        individual consciousness remains the sole judge of the exact
        impression momentarily received by each person, yet we are
        certain that the sensation of heat and cold, like the expansion
        and contraction of the mercury, is in every case dependent on a
        universal law.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        It might seem from Mr. Campbell&#8217;s language (I do not imagine
        that he means it so) as if Modern Experimental Science had
        arrived at something more trustworthy than &#8220;individual
        impressions of sense&#8221;. But the expansion or contraction of the
        mercury are just as much facts of sense as the feeling of heat
        or cold; only they are facts of sense determinate and uniform to
        all, whereas the feeling of heat or cold is indeterminate and
        liable to differ with different persons. The certainty about
        &#8220;universal law governing the sensations of heat and cold,&#8221; was
        not at all felt in the days of Plato.</p>

        Thus in the Phil&ecirc;bus (pp. 55-56) Plato declares that
        numbering, measuring, and weighing, are the characteristic marks
        of all the various processes which deserve the name of Arts; and
        that among the different Arts those of the carpenter, builder,
        &amp;c., are superior to those of the physician, pilot,
        husbandman, military commander, musical composer, &amp;c.,
        because the two first-named employ more measurement and a
        greater number of measuring instruments, the rule, line,
        plummet, compass, &amp;c. </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;When we talk about iron or silver&#8221; (says Sokrates in the
        Platonic Ph&aelig;drus, p. 263 A-B) &#8220;we are all of one mind, but
        when we talk about the Just and the Good we are all at variance
        with each other, and each man is at variance with himself&#8221;.
        Compare an analogous passage, Alkibiad. I. p. 109. </p>
      <p>
        Here Plato himself recognises the verifications of sense as the
        main guarantee for accuracy: and the compared facts of sense,
        when select and simplified, as ensuring the nearest approach to
        unanimity among believers.</p>

    <p>
      A loose adumbration of this doctrine is here given by Plato as the

    <p>
      This is an important question and answer, which Plato
      unfortunately does not follow up. It brings to view, though
      without fully unfolding, the distinction between what is really
      perceived by sense, and what is inferred from such perception:
      either through resemblance or through conjunctions of past
      experience treasured up in memory &#8212; or both together. Without
      having regard to such distinction, no one can discuss
      satisfactorily the question under debate.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_87" href="#Footnotev3_28_87"><span
          class="sp">87</span></a> Plato here abandons, moreover, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page157" id="v3page157"></a>157</span>the
      subjective variety of impression which he had before noticed as
      the characteristic of sense:&#8212; (the wind which blows cold, and the
      wine which tastes sweet, to one man, but not to another). Here it
      is assumed that all men hear the sounds, and see the written
      letters alike: the divergence between one man and another arises
      from the different prior condition of percipient minds, differing
      from each other in associative and reminiscent power.</p>

        I borrow here a striking passage from Dugald Stewart, which
        illustrates both the passage in Plato&#8217;s text, and the general
        question as to the relativity of Cognition. Here, the fact of
        relative Cognition is brought out most conspicuously on its
        intellectual side, not on its perceptive side. The fact of sense
        is the same to all, and therefore, though really relative, has
        more the look of an absolute; but the mental associations with
        that fact are different with different persons, and therefore
        are more obviously and palpably relative. &#8212; Dugald Stewart,
        First Preliminary Dissertation to Encyclop&aelig;d. Britannica,
        pp. 66, 8th ed.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;To this reference of the sensation of colour to the external
        object, I can think of nothing so analogous as the feelings we
        experience in surveying a library of books. We speak of the
        volumes piled up on its shelves as <i>treasures</i> or <i>magazines</i>
        of the knowledge of past ages; and contemplate them with
        gratitude and reverence as inexhaustible <i>sources</i> of
        instruction and delight to the mind. Even in looking at a page
        of print or manuscript, we are apt to say that the ideas we
        acquire are received by the sense of sight; and we are scarcely
        conscious of a metaphor when we apply this language. On such
        occasions we seldom recollect that nothing is perceived by the
        eye but a multitude of <i>black strokes drawn upon white paper</i>,
        and that it is our own acquired habits which communicate to
        these <i>strokes</i> the whole of that significancy whereby
        they are distinguished from the unmeaning scrawling of an
        infant. The knowledge which we conceive to be preserved in
        books, like the fragrance of a rose, or the gilding of the
        clouds, depends, for its existence, on the <i>relation</i>
        between the object and the percipient mind: and the only
        difference between the two cases is, that, in the one, this
        relation is the local and temporary effect of conventional
        habits: in the other, it is the universal and the unchangeable
        work of nature.&#8230; What has now been remarked with respect to <i>written
          characters</i>, may be extended very nearly to <i>oral
          language</i>. When we listen to the discourse of a public
        speaker, eloquence and persuasion seem to issue from his lips;
        and we are little aware that we ourselves infuse the soul into
        every word that he utters. The case is exactly the same when we
        enjoy the conversation of a friend. We ascribe the charm
        entirely to his voice and accents; but without our co-operation,
        its potency would vanish. How very small the comparative
        proportion is, which in such cases the words spoken contribute
        to the intellectual and moral effect, I have elsewhere
        endeavoured to show.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Sokrates turns to another argument. If knowledge be the same thing
      as sensible perception, then it follows, that so soon as a man
      ceases to see and hear, he also ceases to know. The memory of what
      he has seen or heard, upon that supposition, is not knowledge. But
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus admits that a man who remembers what he has
      seen or heard does know it. Accordingly, the answer that knowledge

    <p>
      Here Sokrates makes out a good case against the answer in its
      present wording. But we may fairly doubt whether those who
      affirmed the matter of knowledge to consist in the facts of sense,
      ever meant to exclude memory. They meant probably the facts of
      sense both as perceived and as remembered; though the wording
      cited by Plato does not strictly include so much. Besides, we must
      recollect, that Plato includes in the meaning of the word
      Knowledge or Cognition an idea of perfect infallibility:
      distinguishing it generically from the highest form of opinion.
      But memory is a fallible process: sometimes quite trustworthy &#8212;
      under other circumstances, not so. Accordingly, memory, in a
      general sense, cannot be put on a level with present perception,
      nor said to generate what Plato calls knowledge.</p>

        and not seeing at the same time .</span></p>
    <p>
      The next argument of Plato is as follows. You can see, and not
      see, the same thing at the same time: for you may close one of
      your eyes, and look only with the other. But it is impossible to
      know a thing, and not <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page158"
          id="v3page158"></a>158</span>to know it at the same time.
      Therefore <i>to know</i> is not the same as <i>to see</i>.<a

        Plato, The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 165 B.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      This argument is proclaimed by Plato as a terrible puzzle, leaving
      no escape.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_90" href="#Footnotev3_28_90"><span
          class="sp">90</span></a> Perhaps he meant to speak ironically.
      In reality, this puzzle is nothing but a false inference deduced
      from a false premiss. The inference is false, because if we grant
      the premiss, that it is possible both to <i>see</i> a thing, and
      <i>not to see</i> it, at the same time &#8212; there is no reason why it
      should not also be possible to <i>know</i> a thing, and <i>not
        to know</i> it, at the same time. Moreover, the premiss is also
      false in the ordinary sense which the words bear: and not merely
      false, but logically impossible, as a sin against the maxim of
      contradiction. Plato procures it from a true premiss, by omitting
      an essential qualification. I see an object with my open eye: I do
      not see it with my closed eye. From this double proposition, alike
      intelligible and true, Plato thinks himself authorised to discard
      the qualification, and to tell me that I see a thing and do not
      see it &#8212; passing <i>&agrave; dicto secundum quid ad dictum
        simpliciter</i>. This is the same liberty which he took with the
      Protagorean doctrine. Protagoras having said &#8212; &#8220;Every thing which
      any man believes is true <i>to that man</i>&#8221; &#8212; Plato reasons
      against him as if he had said &#8212; &#8220;Every thing which any man
      believes is <i>true</i>&#8221;.</p>

      <p>
        Mr. Campbell observes upon this passage:&#8212; &#8220;Perhaps there is here
        a trace of the spirit which was afterwards developed in the
        sophisms of Eubulid&ecirc;s&#8221;. Stallbaum, while acknowledging the
        many subtleties of Sokrates in this dialogue, complains that
        other commentators make the ridiculous mistake (&#8220;errore perquam
        ridiculo&#8221;) of accepting all the reasoning of Sokrates as
        seriously meant, whereas much of it (he says) is mere mockery
        and sarcasm, intended to retort upon the Sophists their own
        argumentative tricks and quibbles. &#8212; &#8220;Itaqu&egrave; s&aelig;pe
        per petulantiam quandam argutiis indulget (Socrates), quibus
        isti haudquaquam abstinebant: s&aelig;p&egrave; ex adversariorum
        mente disputat, sed ita tamen disputat, ut eos suis ipsorum
        capiat laqueis; s&aelig;p&egrave; denique in disputando iisdem
        artificiis utitur, quibus illi uti consueverant, sicuti etiam in
        Menone, Cratylo, Euthydemo, fieri meminimus&#8221;. (Stallbaum,
        Proleg. ad The&aelig;t. pp. 12-13, 22-29).</p>
      <p>
        Stallbaum pushes this general principle so far as to contend
        that the simile of the waxen tablet (p. 191 C), and that of the
        pigeon-house (p. 200 C), are doctrines of opponents, which
        Sokrates pretends to adopt with a view to hold them up to
        ridicule.</p>
      <p>
        I do not concur in this opinion of Stallbaum, which he
        reproduces in commenting on many other dialogues, and especially
        on the Kratylus, for the purpose of exonerating Plato from the
        reproach of bad reasoning and bad etymology, at the cost of
        opponents &#8220;inauditi et indefensi&#8221;. I see no ground for believing
        that Plato meant to bring forward these arguments as paralogisms
        obviously and ridiculously silly. He produced them, in my
        judgment, as suitable items in a dialogue of search: plausible
        to a certain extent, admitting both of being supported and
        opposed, and necessary to be presented to those who wish to know
        a question in all its bearings.</p>

      every thing was in flux and movement, partly to satirise their

        ascribes to that Sophist and Dionysodorus. But Steinhart says
        that Plato is here reasoning in the style of Protagoras: an
        assertion thoroughly gratuitous, for which there is no evidence
        at all (Steinhart, Einleitung zum The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 53).</p>

        Plato, The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. pp. 179-183. The description which

        Ionia, who speculated in the vein of Herakleitus &#8212; is full of
        vivid fancy and smartness, but is for that reason the less to be
        trusted as accurate.</p>
      <p>
        The characteristic features ascribed to these Herakleiteans are
        quite unlike to the features of Protagoras, so far as we know
        them; though Protagoras, nevertheless, throughout this dialogue,
        is spoken of as if he were an Herakleitean. These men are here
        depicted as half mad &#8212; incapable of continuous attention &#8212;
        hating all systematic speech and debate &#8212; answering, when
        addressed, only in brief, symbolical, enigmatic phrases, of
        which they had a quiver-full, but which they never condescended
        to explain (&#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#954; &#966;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#962; &#8165;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#953;&#945; &#945;&#7984;&#957;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#974;&#948;&#951; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#960;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;

        spontaneous inspiration, despising instruction, p. 180 A), and
        each looking down upon the others as ignorant. <span class="correction" title="amended from 'It'">If</span> we compare the
        picture thus given by Plato of the Herakleiteans, with the
        picture which he gives of Protagoras in the dialogue so called,
        we shall see that the two are as unlike as possible.</p>
      <p>
        Lassalle, in his elaborate work on the philosophy of
        Herakleitus, attempts to establish the philosophical affinity
        between Herakleitus and Protagoras: but in my judgment
        unsuccessfully. According to Lassalle&#8217;s own representation of
        the doctrine of Herakleitus, it is altogether opposed to the
        most eminent Protagorean doctrine, &#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8183; &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#8212; and
        equally opposed to that which Plato seems to imply as
        Protagorean &#8212; &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; = &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;. The elucidation given by
        Lassalle of Herakleitus, through the analogy of Hegel, is
        certainly curious and instructive. The Absolute Process of
        Herakleitus is at variance with Protagoras, not less than the
        Absolute Object or Substratum of the Eleates, or the Absolute
        Ideas of Plato. Lassalle admits that Herakleitus is the entire
        antithesis to Protagoras, yet still contends that he is the
        prior stage of transition towards Protagoras (vol. i. p. 64).</p>

      We thus perceive objects of sense, according to Plato&#8217;s language,
      <i>with</i> the central form or soul, and <i>through</i> various
      organs of the body. The various Percepta or Percipienda of tact,
      vision, hearing &#8212; sweet, hot, hard, light &#8212; have each its special
      bodily organ. But no one of these can be perceived through the
      organ affected to any other. Whatever therefore we conceive or
      judge respecting any two of them, is not performed through the
      organ special to either. If we conceive any thing common both to
      sound and colour, we cannot conceive it either through the
      auditory or through the visual organ.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_94"

      Now there are certain judgments (Sokrates argues) which we make
      common to both, and not exclusively belonging to either. First, we
      judge that they are two: that each is one, different from the
      other, and the same with itself: that each <i>is</i> something,
      or has existence, and that one <i>is not</i> the other. Here are
      predicates &#8212; existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness,
      unity, plurality, sameness, difference, &amp;c., which we affirm,
      or deny, not respecting either of these sensations exclusively,
      but respecting all of them. Through what bodily organ do we derive
      these judgments respecting what is common to all? There is no
      special organ: the mind perceives, through itself these common

      arrives at these purely mental apprehensions, only by going over,

      <p>
        Base and honourable, evil and good, are here pointed out by
        Sokrates as most evidently and emphatically <i>relative</i>. In
        the train of reasoning here terminated, Plato had been combating
        the doctrine &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; = &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;. In his sense of the word
        &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; he has refuted the doctrine. But what about the other
        doctrine, which he declares to be a part of the same programme &#8212;
        <i>Homo Mensura</i> &#8212; the Protagorean formula? That formula, so
        far from being refuted, is actually sustained and established by
        this train of reasoning. Plato has declared &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;,
        &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;, &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#957;, &amp;c., to be a distinct class of
        Objects not perceived by Sense. But he also tells us that they
        are apprehended by the Mind through its own working, and that
        they are apprehended always in relation to each other. We thus
        see that they are just as much relative to the concipient mind,
        as the Objects of sense are to the percipient and sentient mind.
        The Subject is the correlative limit or measure (to use
        Protagorean phrases) of one as well as of the other. This
        confirms what I observed above, that the two doctrines, 1. Homo
        Mensura, 2. &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; = &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, &#8212; are completely distinct and
        independent, though Plato has chosen to implicate or identify
        them.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_28_47"></a>Examination of this view &#8212;
        Distinction from the views of modern philosophers.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such is the doctrine which Plato here lays down, respecting the
      difference between sensible perception, and knowledge or
      cognition. From his time to the present day, the same topic has
      continued to be discussed, with different opinions on the part of
      philosophers. Plato&#8217;s views are interesting, as far as his
      language enables us to make them out. He does not agree with those
      who treat sensation or sensible perception (in his language, the
      two are not distinguished) as a bodily phenomenon, and
      intelligence as a mental phenomenon. He regards both as belonging
      to the mind or soul. He considers that the mind is sentient as
      well as intelligent: and moreover, that the sentient mind is the
      essential basis and preliminary &#8212; universal among men and animals,
      as well as co&aelig;val with birth &#8212; furnishing all the matter,
      upon which the intelligent mind has to work. He says nothing, in
      this dialogue, about the three distinct souls or minds (rational,
      courageous, and appetitive), in one and the same body, which form
      so capital a feature in his Tim&aelig;us and Republic: nothing
      about eternal, self-existent, substantial Ideas, or about the
      pre-existence of the soul and its reminiscence as the process of
      acquiring knowledge. Nor does he countenance the doctrine of
      innate ideas, instinctive beliefs, immediate mental intuitions,
      internal senses, &amp;c., which have been recognised by <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page163" id="v3page163"></a>163</span>many
      philosophers. Plato supposes the intelligent mind to work
      altogether upon the facts of sense; to review and compare them
      with one another; and to compute facts present or past, with a
      view to the future. All this is quite different from the mental
      intuitions and instincts, assumed by various modern philosophers
      as common to all mankind. The operations, which Plato ascribes to
      the intelligent mind, are said to be out of the reach of the
      common man, and not to be attainable except by a few, with
      difficulty and labour. The distinctive feature of the sentient
      mind, according to him, is, that it operates through a special
      bodily organ of sense: whereas the intelligent mind has no such
      special bodily organ.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_48"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_48"></a>Different views given by Plato in
        other dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>
      But this distinction, in the first place, is not consistent with
      Tim&aelig;us &#8212; wherein Plato assigns to each of his three human
      souls a separate and special region of the bodily organism, as its
      physical basis. Nor, in the second place, is it consistent with
      that larger range of observed facts which the farther development
      of physiology has brought to view. To Plato and Aristotle the
      nerves and the nervous system were wholly unknown: but it is now
      ascertained that the optic, auditory, and other nerves of sense,
      are only branches of a complicated system of sensory and motory
      nerves, attached to the brain and spinal cord as a centre: each
      nerve of sense having its own special mode of excitability or
      manifestation. Now the physical agency whereby sensation is
      carried on, is, not the organ of sense alone, but the cerebral
      centre acting along with that organ: whereas in the intellectual
      and memorial processes, the agency of the cerebral centre and
      other internal parts of the nervous system are sufficient, without
      any excitement beginning at the peripheral extremity of the
      special organ of sense, or even though that organ be disabled. We
      know the intelligent mind only in an embodied condition: that is,
      as working along with and through its own physical agency. When
      Plato, therefore, says that the mind thinks, computes, compares,
      &amp;c., by itself &#8212; this is true only as signifying that it does
      so without the initiatory stimulus of a special organ of sense;
      not as signifying that it does so without the central nervous
      force or currents &#8212; an agency essential alike to thought, to
      sensation, to emotion, and to appetite.</p>

        here exhibits a remarkable advance in analytical psychology. The
        mind rises from Sensation, first to Opinion, then to Cognition.</span></p>
    <p>
      Putting ourselves back to the Platonic period, we must recognise
      that the discussion of the theory &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; = &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;, as it is
      conducted by Plato, exhibits a remarkable advance in psychological
      analysis. In analysing the mental phenomena, Plato displayed much
      more subtlety and acuteness than his predecessors &#8212; as far at
      least as we have the means of appreciating the latter. It is
      convenient to distinguish intellect from sensation (or sensible
      perception) and emotion, though both of them are essential and
      co-ordinate parts of our mental system, and are so recognised by
      Plato. It is also true that the discrimination of our sensations
      from each other, comparisons of likeness or unlikeness between
      them, observation of co-existence or sequence, and apprehension of
      other relations between them, &amp;c., are more properly
      classified as belonging to intellect than to sense. But the
      language of psychology is, and always has been, so indeterminate,
      that it is difficult to say how much any writer means to include
      under the terms Sense<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_99"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> &#8212;
      Sensation &#8212; Sensible Perception &#8212; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. The <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page165" id="v3page165"></a>165</span>propositions
      in which our knowledge is embodied, affirm &#8212; not sensations
      detached and isolated, but &#8212; various relations of antecedence<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page166" id="v3page166"></a>166</span>
      and consequence, likeness, difference, &amp;c., between two or
      more sensations or facts of sense. We rise thus to a state of mind
      more complicated than simple sensation: including (along with
      sensation), association, memory, discrimination, comparison of
      sensations, abstraction, and generalisation. This is what Plato
      calls opinion<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_100" href="#Footnotev3_28_100"><span
          class="sp">100</span></a> or belief; a mental process, which,
      though presupposing sensations and based upon them, he affirms to
      be carried on by the mind through itself, not through any special
      bodily organ. In this respect it agrees with what he calls
      knowledge or cognition. Opinion or belief is the lowest form,
      possessed in different grades by all men, of this exclusively
      mental process: knowledge or cognition is the highest form of <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page167" id="v3page167"></a>167</span>the
      same, attained only by a select few. Both opinion, and cognition,
      consist in comparisons and computations made by the mind about the
      facts of sense. But cognition (in Plato&#8217;s view) has special
      marks:&#8212; </p>
    <p>1. That it is infallible, while opinion is fallible. You have it<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_101" href="#Footnotev3_28_101"><span
          class="sp">101</span></a> or you have it not &#8212; but there is no
      mistake possible.</p>
    <p>2. That it apprehends what Plato calls the real essence of
      things, and real truth, which, on the contrary, Opinion does not
      apprehend.</p>
    <p>3. That the person who possesses it can maintain his own
      consistency under cross-examination, and can test the consistency
      of others by cross-examining them (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;).</p>

        The discussion in pp. 184-186-186 of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is interesting as the earliest attempt remaining to classify
        psychological phenomena. What Demokritus and others proposed
        with the same view &#8212; the analogy or discrepancy between &#964;&#8056;
        &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; and &#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#8212; we gather only from the brief notices
        of Aristotle and others. Plato considers himself to have
        established, that &#8220;cognition is not to be sought at all in
        sensible perception, but in that function, whatever it be, which
        is predicated of the mind when it busies itself <i>per se</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
        not through any special bodily organ) about existences&#8221; (p. 187
        A). We may here remark, as to the dispute between Plato and
        Protagoras, that Plato here does not at all escape from the
        region of the Relative, or from the Protagorean formula, <i>Homo
          Mensura</i>. He passes from Mind Percipient to Mind Cogitant;
        but these new Entia cogitationis (as his language implies) are
        still relative, though relative to the Cogitant and not to the
        Percipient. He reduces Mind Sentient to the narrowest functions,
        including only each isolated impression of one or other among
        the five senses. When we see a clock on the wall and hear it
        strike twelve &#8212; we have a visual impression of black from the
        hands, of white from the face, and an audible impression from
        each stroke. But this is all (according to Plato) which we have
        from sense, or which addresses itself to the sentient mind. All
        beyond this (according to him) is apprehended by the cogitant
        mind: all discrimination, comparison, and relation &#8212; such as the
        succession, or one, two, three, &amp;c., of the separate
        impressions, the likeness of one stroke to the preceding, the
        contrast or dissimilarity of the black with the white &#8212; even the
        simplest acts of discrimination or comparison belong (in Plato&#8217;s
        view) to mental powers beyond and apart from sense; much more,
        of course, apprehension of the common properties of all, and of
        those extreme abstractions to which we apply the words Ens and
        Non-Ens (&#964;&#972; &#964;&#8217; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962;, &#8103; &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;
        &#7952;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, p. 185 C).</p>
      <p>
        When Plato thus narrows the sense of &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, it is easy to
        prove that &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; is not &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;; but I doubt whether those
        who affirmed this proposition intended what he here refutes.
        Neither unreflecting men, nor early theorizers, would
        distinguish the impressions of sense from the feeling of such
        impressions being <i>successive, distinct from one another,
          resembling, &amp;c.</i> Mr. John Stuart Mill observes (Logic,
        Book i. chap. iii. sects. 10-13) &#8212; &#8220;The simplest of all
        relations are those expressed by the words antecedent and
        consequent, and by the word simultaneous. If we say dawn
        preceded sunrise, the fact in which the two things dawn and
        sunrise were jointly concerned, consisted only of the two things
        themselves. No third thing entered into the fact or phenomenon
        at all, unless indeed we choose to call the succession of the
        two objects a third thing; <i>but their succession is not
          something added to the things themselves</i>, it is something
        <i>involved in them</i>. To have two feelings at all, implies
        having them either successively or simultaneously. The relations
        of succession and simultaneity, of likeness and unlikeness, not
        being grounded on any fact or phenomenon distinct from the
        related objects themselves, do not admit of the same kind of
        analysis. But these relations, though not (like other relations)
        grounded on states of consciousness, are themselves states of
        consciousness. Resemblance is nothing but our feeling of
        resemblance: succession is nothing but our feeling of
        succession.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        By all ordinary (non-theorising) persons, these familiar
        relations, <i>involved</i> in the facts of sense, are conceived
        as an essential part of &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;: and are so conceived by those
        modern theorists who trace all our knowledge to sense &#8212; as well
        as (probably) by those ancient theorists who defined &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; to
        be &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, and against whom Plato here reasons. These
        theorists would have said (as ordinary language recognises) &#8212;
        &#8220;We <i>see</i> the <i>dissimilarity</i> of the black hands
        from the white face of the clock; we <i>hear</i> the <i>likeness</i>
        of one stroke of the clock to another, and the <i>succession</i>
        of the strokes one, two, three, one after the other&#8221;.</p>
      <p>
        The reasoning of Plato against these opponents is thus open to
        many of the remarks made by Sir William Hamilton, in the notes
        to his edition of Reid&#8217;s works, upon Reid&#8217;s objections against
        Locke and Berkeley: Reid restricted the word Sensation to a much
        narrower meaning than that given to it by Locke and Berkeley.
        &#8220;Berkeley&#8217;s <i>Sensation</i>&#8221; (observes S. W. Hamilton) &#8220;was
        equivalent to Reid&#8217;s <i>Sensation</i> plus <i>Perception</i>.
        This is manifest even by the passages adduced in the text&#8221; (note
        to p. 289). But Reid in his remarks omits to notice this
        difference in the meaning of the same word. The case is similar
        with Plato when he refutes those who held the doctrine &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;
        = &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. The last-mentioned word, in his construction,
        includes only a part of the meaning which they attributed to it;
        but he takes no notice of this verbal difference. Sir William
        Hamilton remarks, respecting M. Royer Collard&#8217;s doctrine, which
        narrows prodigiously the province of Sense, &#8212; &#8220;<i>Sense</i> he
        so limits that, if rigorously carried out, no sensible
        perception, as no consciousness, could be brought to bear&#8221;. This
        is exactly true about Plato&#8217;s doctrine narrowing &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. See
        Hamilton&#8217;s edit. of Reid, Appendix, p. 844.</p>
      <p>
        Aristotle understands &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8052; or &#950;&#969;&#942; &#8212; as
        occupying a larger sphere than that which Plato assigns to them
        in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. Aristotle recognises the five
        separate &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;, each correlating with and perceiving its
        &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#957;: he also recognises &#7969; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; common
        sensation or perception &#8212; correlating with (or perceiving) &#964;&#8048;
        &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;, which are <i>motion</i>, <i>rest</i>, <i>magnitude</i>,
        <i>figure</i>, <i>number</i>. The &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; is not a
        distinct or sixth sense, apart from the five, but a general
        power inhering in all of them. He farther recognises &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; as
        discriminating, judging, comparing, knowing: this
        characteristic, &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#8056;&#957; and &#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, is common to
        &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;, &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, and distinguishes them all from
        appetite &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#8000;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, &#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, &amp;c. See the first and
        second chapters of the third Book of the Treatise De
        Anim&acirc;, and the Commentary of Simplikius upon that
        Treatise, especially p. 56, b. Aristotle tells us that all
        animals &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957; &#963;&#973;&#956;&#966;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#957;, &#7971;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;.
        Anal. Poster. ii. p. 99, b. 35. And Sir William Hamilton adopts
        a similar view, when he remarks, that Judgment is implied in
        every act of Consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        Occasionally indeed Aristotle partitions the soul between &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;
        and &#8004;&#961;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962; &#8212; Intelligence and Appetite &#8212; recognising Sense as
        belonging to the head of Intelligence &#8212; see De Motu Animalium,

      <p>
        It will thus be seen that while Plato severs pointedly &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;
        from anything like discrimination, comparison, judgment, even in
        the most rudimentary form &#8212; Aristotle refuses to adopt this
        extreme abstraction as his basis for classifying the mental
        phenomena. He recognises a certain measure of discrimination,
        comparison, and judgment, as implicated in sensible perceptions.
        Moreover, that which he calls &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; is unknown to
        Plato, who isolates each sense, and indeed each act of each
        sense, as much as possible. Aristotle is opposed, as Plato is,
        to the doctrine &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; = &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, but he employs a different
        manner of reasoning against it. See, <i>inter alia</i>, Anal.
        Poster. i. 31, p. 87, b. 28. He confines &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; to one branch
        of the &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;.</p>
      <p>
        The Peripatetic Straton, the disciple of Theophrastus, denied
        that there was any distinct line of demarcation between &#964;&#8056;
        &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; and &#964;&#8056; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957;: maintaining that the former was
        impossible without a certain measure of the latter. His
        observation is very worthy of note. Plutarch, De Solerti&acirc;
        Animalium, iii. 6, p. 961 A. &#922;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#931;&#964;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#972;&#962; &#947;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;

      <p>
        Straton here notices that remarkable fact (unnoticed by Plato
        and even by Aristotle, so far as I know) in the process of
        association, that impressions of sense are sometimes unheeded
        when they occur, but force themselves upon the attention
        afterwards, and are recalled by the mind in the order in which
        they occurred at first.</p>

      <p>
        Plato is quite right in distinguishing between &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; and
        &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;, looking at the point as a question of psychological
        classification. It appears to me, however, most probable that
        those who maintained the theory &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; = &#913;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, made no
        such distinction, but included that which he calls &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; in
        &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. Unfortunately we do not possess their own exposition;
        but it cannot have included much of psychological analysis.</p>

        Schleiermacher represents Plato as discriminating Knowledge (the
        region of infallibility, you either possess it or not) from
        Opinion (the region of fallibility, true or false, as the case
        may be) by a broad and impassable line &#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Auch hieraus erw&auml;chst eine sehr entscheidende, nur
        ebenfalls nicht ausdr&uuml;cklich gezogene, Folgerung, dass die
        reine Erkenntniss gar nicht auf demselben Gebiet liegen
        k&ouml;nne mit dem Irrthum &#8212; und es in Beziehung auf sie kein
        Wahr und Falsch gebe, sondern nur ein Haben oder Nicht Haben.&#8221;
        (Schleiermacher, Einleit. zum The&aelig;t. p. 176.) </p>
      <p>
        Steinhart (in his Einleit. zum The&aelig;t. p. 94) contests this
        opinion of Schleiermacher (though he seems to give the same
        opinion himself, p. 92). He thinks that Plato does not recognise
        so very marked a separation between Knowledge and Opinion: that
        he considers Knowledge as the last term of a series of mental
        processes, developed gradually according to constant laws, and
        ascending from Sensible Perception through Opinion to Knowledge:
        that the purpose of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is to illustrate
        this theory. </p>
      <p>
        Ueberweg, on the contrary, defends the opinion of Schleiermacher
        and maintains that Steinhart is mistaken (Aechtheit und Zeit.
        Platon. Schriften, p. 279).</p>
      <p>
        Passages may be produced from Plato&#8217;s writings to support both
        these views: that of Schleiermacher, as well as that of
        Steinhart. In Tim&aelig;us, p. 51 E, the like infallibility is
        postulated for &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962; (which there represents &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;) as
        contrasted with &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;. But I think that Steinhart ascribes to the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus more than can fairly be discovered in it.
        That dialogue is purely negative. It declares that &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; is <i>not</i>
        &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. It then attempts to go a step farther towards the
        affirmative, by declaring also that &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; is a mental process
        of computation, respecting the impressions of &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; that it
        is &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, which is equivalent to &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;: compare
        Ph&aelig;drus, 249 B. But this affirmative attempt breaks down:
        for Sokrates cannot explain what &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; is, nor how &#964;&#8056;
        &#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8134; is possible; in fact he says (p. 200 B) that this
        cannot be explained until we know what &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; is. The entire
        result of the dialogue is negative, as the closing words
        proclaim emphatically. On this point many of the commentators
        agree &#8212; Ast, Socher, Stallbaum, Ueberweg, Zeller, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it be true, as Schleiermacher, with several others,
        thinks (Einl. pp. 184-185), that Plato intends to attack
        Aristippus in the first part of the dialogue, and Antisthenes in
        the latter part, we have no means of determining.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      This at least is the meaning which Plato assigns to the two words
      corresponding to Cognition and to Opinion, in the present
      dialogue, and often elsewhere. But he also frequently employs the
      word Cognition in a lower and more general signification, not <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page168" id="v3page168"></a>168</span>restricted,
      as it is here, to the highest philosophical reach, with
      infallibility &#8212; but comprehending much of what is here treated
      only as <i>opinion</i>. Thus, for example, he often alludes to
      the various professional men as possessing <i>Cognition</i>, each
      in his respective department: the general, the physician, the
      gymnast, the steersman, the husbandman, &amp;c.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_102" href="#Footnotev3_28_102"><span
          class="sp">102</span></a> But he certainly does not mean, that
      each of them has attained what he calls real essence and
      philosophical truths &#8212; or that any of them are infallible.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_50"

        from experience, or from facts of sense, as either necessary or
        possible.</span></p>
    <p>
      One farther remark must be made on Plato&#8217;s doctrine. His remark &#8212;
      That Cognition consists not in the affections of sense, but in
      computation or reasoning respecting those affections, (<i>i. e.</i>
      abstraction, generalisation, &amp;c.) &#8212; is both true and
      important. But he has not added, nor would he have admitted, that
      if we are to decide whether our computation is true and right, or
      false and erroneous &#8212; our surest way is to recur to the simple
      facts of sense. Theory must be verified by observation; wherever
      that cannot be done, the best guarantee is wanting. The facts
      themselves are not cognition: yet they are the test by which all
      computations, pretending to be cognitions, must be tried.<a

        See the remarks on the necessity of Verification, as a guarantee
        for the Deductive Process, in Mr. John Stuart Mill&#8217;s System of
        Logic, Book iii. ch. xi. s. 8. Newton puts aside his own
        computation or theory respecting gravity as the force which kept
        the moon in its orbit, because the facts reported by observers
        respecting the lunar motions were for some time not in harmony
        with it. Plato certainly would not have surrendered any
        &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; under the same respect to observed facts. Aristotle
        might probably have done so; but this is uncertain.</p>

      We have thus, in enquiring &#8212; What is Knowledge or Cognition?

      If indeed a man ascribed to any subject a predicate which was
      non-existent, this would be evidently a false opinion. But how can
      any one conceive the non-existent? He who conceives must conceive
      <i>something</i>: just as he who sees or touches, must see or
      touch <i>something</i>. He cannot see or touch the non-existent:
      for that would be to see or touch nothing: in other words, not to
      see or touch at all. In the same manner, to conceive the
      non-existent, or <i>nothing</i>, is impossible.<a

    <p>
      Let us look again in another direction (continues Sokrates). We
      have been hasty in our concessions. Is it really impossible for a
      man to conceive, that a thing, which he knows, is another thing
      which he does not know? Let us see. Grant me the hypothesis (for
      the sake of illustration), that each man has in his mind a waxen <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page170" id="v3page170"></a>170</span>tablet
      &#8212; the wax of one tablet being larger, firmer, cleaner, and better
      in every way, than that of another: the gift of Mnemosyn&ecirc;,
      for inscribing and registering our sensible perceptions and
      thoughts. Every man remembers and knows these, so long as the
      impressions of them remain upon his tablet: as soon as they are
      blotted out, he has forgotten them and no longer knows them.<a

          class="sp">109</span></a> Now false opinion may occur thus. A
      man having inscribed on his memorial tablet the impressions of two
      objects A and B, which he has seen before, may come to see one of
      these objects again; but he may by mistake identify the present
      sensation with the wrong past impression, or with that past
      impression to which it does not belong. Thus on seeing A, he may
      erroneously identify it with the past impression B, instead of A:

        Dilemma. Either false opinion is impossible, or else a man may
        know what he does not know.</span></p>
    <p>
      Having laid this down, however, Sokrates immediately proceeds to
      refute it. In point of fact, false conceptions are found to
      prevail, not only in the wrong identification of present
      sensations with past impressions or thoughts, but also in the
      wrong identification of one past impression or thought with
      another. Thus a man, who has clearly engraved on his memorial
      tablet the conceptions of five, seven, eleven, twelve, &#8212; may
      nevertheless, when asked what is the sum of seven and five, commit

    <p>
      To this question no answer is given. But Sokrates, &#8212; after
      remarking on the confused and unphilosophical manner in which the
      debate has been conducted, both he and The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
      having perpetually employed the <span class="pagenum"><a

      <i>knowledge</i>, and their equivalents, as if the meaning of the
      words were ascertained, whereas the very problem debated is, to
      ascertain their meaning<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_113"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a> &#8212;
      takes up another path of enquiry. He distinguishes between
      possessing knowledge, &#8212; and having it actually in hand or on his
      person: which distinction he illustrates by comparing the mind to
      a pigeon-cage. A man hunts and catches pigeons, then turns them
      into the cage, within the limits of which they fly about: when he
      wants to catch any one of them for use, he has to go through a
      second hunt, sometimes very troublesome: in which he may perhaps
      either fail altogether, or catch the wrong one instead of the
      right. The first hunt Sokrates compares to the acquisition of
      knowledge: the second, to the getting it into his hand for use.<a

      with another: and this constitutes false opinion &#8212; the confusion

        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; That there may be non-cognitions in the

        in confounding one with the other. Sokrates rejects this.</span></p>
    <p>
      Yet how can such a confusion be possible? (Sokrates here again
      replies to himself.) How can knowledge betray a man into such
      error? If he knows A, and knows B &#8212; how can he mistake A for B?
      Upon this supposition, knowledge produces the effect of ignorance:
      and we might just as reasonably imagine ignorance to produce the
      effects of knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_116"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> &#8212;
      Perhaps (suggests The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus), he may have <i>non-cognitions</i>
      in his mind, mingled with the cognitions: and in hunting for a
      cognition, he may catch a non-cognition. Herein may lie false
      opinion. &#8212; That can hardly be (replies Sokrates). If the man
      catches what is really a non-cognition, he will not suppose it to
      be such, but to be a cognition. He will believe himself fully to <i>know</i>,
      that in which he is mistaken. But how is it possible that he
      should confound a non-cognition with a cognition, or <i>vice <span
          class="pagenum"><a name="v3page172" id="v3page172"></a>172</span>vers&acirc;</i>?
      Does not he know the one from the other? We must then require him
      to have a separate cognition of his own cognitions or
      non-cognitions &#8212; and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.<a

    <p>
      Moreover, as to the question, Whether knowledge is identical with

      is not so: and that the two are widely different. You can
      communicate true opinion without communicating knowledge: and the
      powerful class of rhetors and litigants make it their special
      business to do so. They persuade, without teaching, a numerous

        The distinction between persuading and teaching &#8212; between
        creating opinion and imparting knowledge &#8212; has been brought to
        view in the Gorgias, and is noted also in the Tim&aelig;us. As
        it stands here, it deserves notice, because Plato not only
        professes to affirm what <i>knowledge</i> is, but also
        identifies it with sensible perception. The Dikasts (according
        to Sokrates) would have <i>known</i> the case, had they been
        present when it occurred, so as to see and hear it: there is no
        other way of acquiring knowledge.</p>
      <p>
        Hearing the case only by the narration of speakers, they can
        acquire nothing more than a <i>true opinion</i>. Hence we learn
        wherein consists the difference between the two. That which I
        see, hear, or apprehend by any sensible perception, I <i>know</i>:
        compare a passage in Sophistes, p. 267 A-B, where &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;
        is explained in the same way. But that which I learn from the
        testimony of others amounts to nothing more than opinion; and at
        best to a true opinion.</p>
      <p>
        Plato&#8217;s reasoning here involves an admission of the very
        doctrine which he had before taken so much pains to confute &#8212;
        the doctrine that Cognition is Sensible Perception. Yet he takes
        no notice of the inconsistency. An occasion for sneering at the
        Rhetors and Dikasts is always tempting to him.</p>
      <p>
        So, in the Menon (p. 97 B), the man who has been at Larissa is
        said to <i>know</i> the road to Larissa; as distinguished from
        another man who, never having been there, opines correctly which
        the road is. And in the Sophistes (p. 263) when Plato is
        illustrating the doctrine that false propositions, as well as
        true propositions, are possible, and really occur, he selects as
        his cases, &#920;&#949;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#940;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#920;&#949;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#941;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;. That one of
        these propositions is false and the other true, can be known
        only by &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; in the sense of that word commonly
        understood.</p>

        Analogy of letters and words, primordial elements and compounds.
        Elements cannot be explained: compounds alone can be explained.</span></p>
    <p>
      Taking up this definition, and elucidating it farther, Sokrates
      refers to the analogy of words and letters. Letters answer to the
      primordial elements of things; which are not matters either of
      knowledge, or of true opinion, or of rational explanation &#8212; but
      simply of sensible perception. A letter, or a primordial element,
      can only be perceived and called by its name. You cannot affirm of
      it any predicate or any epithet: you cannot call it <i>existing</i>,
      or <i>this</i>, or <i>that</i>, or <i>each</i>, or <i>single</i>,
      or by any other name than its own:<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_123"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a> for if
      you do, you attach to it something extraneous to itself, and then

        the elements are unknowable, the compound must be unknowable
        also.</span></p>
    <p>
      Having enunciated this definition, as one learnt from another
      person not named, Sokrates proceeds to examine and confute it. It
      rests on the assumption (he says), that the primordial elements
      are themselves unknowable; and that it is only the aggregates
      compounded of them which are knowable. Such an assumption cannot
      be granted. The result is either a real sum total, including both
      the two component elements: or it is a new form, indivisible and
      uncompounded, generated by the two elements, but not identical
      with them nor including them in itself. If the former, it is not
      knowable, because if neither of the elements are knowable, both
      together are not knowable: when you know neither A nor B you
      cannot know either the sum or the product of A and B. If the
      latter, then the result, being indivisible and uncompounded, is
      unknowable for the same reason as the elements are so: it can only
      be named by its own substantive name, but nothing can be
      predicated respecting it.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_125"

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_28_61"
          id="Sidenotev3_28_61"></a>Rational explanation may have one of
        three different meanings. 1. Description in appropriate
        language. 2. Enumeration of all the component elements in the
        compound. In neither of these meanings will the definition of
        Cognition hold.</span></p>
    <p>
      When you say (continues Sokrates) that knowledge is true opinion
      coupled with rational explanation, you may mean by <i>rational
        explanation</i> one of three things. 1. The power of enunciating
      the opinion in clear and appropriate words. This every one learns
      to do, who is not dumb or an idiot: so that in this sense true
      opinion will always carry with it rational explanation. &#8212; 2. The
      power of describing the thing in question by its component
      elements. Thus Hesiod says that there are a hundred distinct
      wooden pieces in a waggon: you and I do not know nor can we
      describe them all: we can distinguish only the more obvious
      fractions &#8212; the wheels, the axle, the body, the yoke, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page175" id="v3page175"></a>175</span>&amp;c.
      Accordingly, we cannot be said to know a waggon: we have only a
      true opinion about it. Such is the second sense of &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; or
      rational explanation. But neither in this sense will the
      proposition hold &#8212; That knowledge is right opinion coupled with
      rational explanation. For suppose that a man can enumerate, spell,
      and write correctly, all the syllables of the name <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus</i>
      &#8212; which would fulfil the conditions of this definition: yet, if he
      mistakes and spells wrongly in any other name, such as <i>Theod&ocirc;rus</i>,
      you will not give him credit for knowledge. You will say that he
      writes <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus</i> correctly, by virtue of right
      opinion simply. It is therefore possible to have right opinion
      coupled with rational explanation, in this second sense also, &#8212;
      yet without possessing knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_127"

        The definition will not hold. For rational explanation, in this
        sense, is already included in true opinion.</span></p>
    <p>
      3. A third meaning of this same word &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; or rational
      explanation, is, that in which it is most commonly understood &#8212; To
      be able to assign some mark whereby the thing to be explained
      differs from every thing else &#8212; to differentiate the thing.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_128" href="#Footnotev3_28_128"><span
          class="sp">128</span></a> Persons, who understand the word in
      this way, affirm, that so long as you only seize what the thing
      has in common with other things, you have only a <i>true opinion</i>
      concerning it: but when you seize what it has peculiar and
      characteristic, you then possess <i>knowledge</i> of it. Such is
      their view: but though it seems plausible at first sight (says
      Sokrates), it will not bear close scrutiny. For in order to have a
      true opinion about any thing, I must have in my mind not only what
      it possesses in common with other things, but what it possesses
      peculiar to itself also. Thus if I have a true opinion about
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, I must have in my mind not only the
      attributes which belong to him in common with other men, but also
      those which belong to him specially and exclusively. Rational
      explanation (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;) in this sense is already comprehended in true
      opinion, and is an essential ingredient in it &#8212; not any new
      element superadded. It will not serve therefore as a distinction
      between true opinion and knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_129"

      Such is the result (continues Sokrates) of our researches
      concerning knowledge. We have found that it is neither sensible
      perception &#8212; nor true opinion &#8212; nor true opinion along with
      rational explanation. But what it is, we have not found. Are we
      still pregnant with any other answer, The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, or
      have we brought forth all that is to come? &#8212; <i>I</i> have
      brought forth (replies The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus) more than I had
      within me, through your furtherance. Well (rejoins Sokrates) &#8212; and

    <p>
      The concluding observations of this elaborate dialogue deserve
      particular attention as illustrating Plato&#8217;s point of view, at the
      time when he composed the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. After a long
      debate, set forth with all the charm of Plato&#8217;s style, no result
      is attained. Three different explanations of knowledge have been
      rejected as untenable.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_132"

      other can be found; nor is any suggestion offered, showing in what

      mere piece of useless ingenuity and elegance: but such is not the
      opinion of Plato himself. Sufficient gain (in his view) will have
      been ensured, if The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus has acquired a greater
      power <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page177" id="v3page177"></a>177</span>of
      testing any fresh explanation which he may attempt of this

      being disabused, at all events, of the false persuasion of knowing
      where he is really ignorant. Such false persuasion of knowledge
      (Plato here intimates) renders a man vexatious to associates;
      while a right estimate of his own knowledge and ignorance fosters
      gentleness and moderation of character. In this view, false
      persuasion of knowledge is an ethical defect, productive of
      positive mischief in a man&#8217;s intercourse with others: the removal
      of it improves his character, even though no ulterior step towards
      real and positive knowledge be made. The important thing is, that
      he should acquire the power of testing and verifying all opinions,
      old as well as new. This, which is the only guarantee against the
      delusive self-satisfaction of sham knowledge, must be firmly
      established in the mind before it is possible to aspire
      effectively to positive and assured knowledge. The negative arm of
      philosophy is in its application prior to the positive, and
      indispensable, as the single protection against error and false
      persuasion of knowledge. Sokrates is here depicted as one in whom
      the negative vein is spontaneous and abundant, even to a pitch of
      discomfort &#8212; as one complaining bitterly, that objections thrust
      themselves upon him, unsought and unwelcome, against conclusions
      which he had himself just previously taken pains to prove at
      length.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_133" href="#Footnotev3_28_133"><span

        I have already observed, however, that in one passage of the
        interrogation carried on by Sokrates (p. 201 A-B, where he is
        distinguishing between persuasion and teaching) he unconsciously
        admits the identity between knowledge and sensible perception.</p>

    <p>
      To form in men&#8217;s minds this testing or verifying power, is one
      main purpose in Plato&#8217;s dialogues of Search &#8212; and in some of them
      the predominant purpose; as he himself announces it to be in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. I have already made the same remark before,
      and I repeat it here; since it is absolutely necessary for
      appreciating these dialogues of Search in their true bearing and
      value. To one who does not take account of the negative arm of
      philosophy, as an auxiliary without which the positive arm will
      strike at random &#8212; half of the Platonic dialogues will teach
      nothing, and will even appear as enigmas &#8212; the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus among the foremost. Plato excites and
      strengthens the interior mental wakefulness of the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page178" id="v3page178"></a>178</span>hearer,
      to judge respecting all affirmative theories, whether coming from
      himself or from others. This purpose is well served by the manner
      in which Sokrates more than once in this dialogue first announces,
      proves, and builds up a theory &#8212; then unexpectedly changes his
      front, disproves, and demolishes it. We are taught that it is not
      difficult to find a certain stock of affirmative argument which
      makes the theory look well from a distance: we must inspect
      closely, and make sure that there are no counter-arguments in the
      background.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_134" href="#Footnotev3_28_134"><span
          class="sp">134</span></a> The way in which Sokrates pulls to
      pieces his own theories, is farther instructive, as it illustrates
      the exhortation previously addressed by him to
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; not to take offence when his answers were

      A portion of the dialogue to which I have not yet adverted,
      illustrates this anxiety for the preliminary training of the
      ratiocinative power, as an indispensable qualification for any
      special research. &#8220;We have plenty of leisure for investigation<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_136" href="#Footnotev3_28_136"><span
          class="sp">136</span></a> (says Sokrates). We are not tied to
      time, nor compelled to march briefly and directly towards some
      positive result. Engaged as we are in investigating philosophical
      truth, we stand in pointed contrast with politicians and rhetors
      in the public assembly or dikastery. We are like freemen; they,
      like slaves. They have before them the Dikasts, as their masters,
      to whose temper and approbation they are constrained to adapt
      themselves. They are also in presence of antagonists, ready to
      entrap and confute them. The personal interests, sometimes even
      the life, of an individual are at stake; so that every thing must
      be sacrificed to the purpose of obtaining a verdict. Men brought
      up in these habits become sharp in observation and emphatic in
      expression; but merely with a view to win the assent and
      approbation of the master before them, as to the case in hand. No
      free aspirations or spontaneous enlargement can have place in
      their minds. They become careless of true and sound reasoning &#8212;
      slaves to the sentiment of those whom they address &#8212; and adepts in
      crooked artifice which they take for wisdom.<a

        fine piece of poetry or rhetoric, and shows that Plato was by
        nature quite as rhetorical as the rhetors whom he depreciates &#8212;
        though he had also, besides, other lofty intellectual
        peculiarities of his own, beyond these rivals.</p>

        debates.</span></p>
    <p>
      Of all this (continues Sokrates) the genuine philosopher is the
      reverse. He neither possesses, nor cares to possess, the
      accomplishments of the lawyer and politician. He takes no interest
      in the current talk of the city; nor in the scandals afloat
      against individual persons. He does not share in the common ardour
      for acquiring power or money; nor does he account potentates
      either happier or more estimable for possessing them. Being
      ignorant and incompetent in the affairs of citizenship as well as
      of common life, he has no taste for club-meetings or joviality.
      His mind, despising the particular and the practical, is absorbed
      in constant theoretical research respecting universals. He spares
      no labour in investigating &#8212; What is man in general? and what are
      the attributes, active and passive, which distinguish man from
      other things? He will be overthrown and humiliated before the
      Dikastery by a clever rhetor. But if this opponent chooses to
      ascend out of the region of speciality, and the particular ground
      of injustice alleged by A against B &#8212; into the general question,
      What is justice or injustice? Wherein do they differ from each
      other or from other things? What constitutes happiness and misery?
      How is the one to be attained and the other avoided? &#8212; If the
      rhetor will meet the philosopher on this elevated ground, then he
      will find himself put to shame and proved to be incompetent, in
      spite of all the acute stratagems of his petty mind.<a

        life of philosophical Search.</span></p>
    <p>
      In these words of Sokrates we read a contrast between practice and
      theory &#8212; one of the most eloquent passages in the dialogues &#8212;
      wherein Plato throws overboard the ordinary concerns and purposes
      both of public and private life, admitting that true philosophers
      are unfit for them. The passage, while it teaches us caution in <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page180" id="v3page180"></a>180</span>receiving
      his criticisms on the defects of actual statesmen and men of
      action, informs us at the same time that he regarded philosophy as
      the only true business of life &#8212; the single pursuit worthy to
      occupy a freeman.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_141"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a> This
      throws light on the purpose of many of his dialogues. He intends
      to qualify the mind for a life of philosophical research, and with
      this view to bestow preliminary systematic training on the
      ratiocinative power. To announce at once his own positive
      conclusions with their reasons, (as I remarked before) is not his
      main purpose. A pupil who, having got all these by heart, supposed
      himself to have completed his course of philosophy, so that
      nothing farther remained to be done, would fall very short of the
      Platonic exigency. The life of the philosopher &#8212; as Plato here
      conceives it &#8212; is a perpetual search after truth, by dialectic
      debate and mutual cross-examination between two minds, aiding each
      other to disembroil that confusion and inconsistency which grows
      up naturally in the ordinary mind. For such a life a man becomes
      rather disqualified than prepared, by swallowing an early dose of
      authoritative dogmas and proofs dictated by his teacher. The two
      essential requisites for it are, that he should acquire a
      self-acting ratiocinative power, and an earnest, untiring,
      interest in the dialectic process. Both these aids Plato&#8217;s
      negative dialogues are well calculated to afford: and when we thus
      look at his purpose, we shall see clearly that it did not require
      the presentation of any positive result.</p>

        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus are not solved in any other Dialogue.</span></p>
    <p>
      The course of this dialogue &#8212; the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; has been
      already described as an assemblage of successive perplexities
      without any solution. But what deserves farther notice is &#8212; That
      the perplexities, as they are not solved in this dialogue, so they
      are not solved in any other dialogue. The view taken by
      Schleiermacher and other critics &#8212; that Plato lays out the
      difficulties in one anterior dialogue, in order to furnish the
      solution in another posterior &#8212; is not borne out by the facts. In
      the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, many objections are propounded against
      the doctrine, That Opinion is sometimes true, sometimes false.
      Sokrates shows that false opinion is an impossibility: either
      therefore all <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page181"
          id="v3page181"></a>181</span>opinions are true, or no opinion
      is either true or false. If we turn to the Sophist&ecirc;s, we
      shall find this same question discussed by the Eleatic Stranger
      who conducts the debate. He there treats the doctrine &#8212; That false
      opinion is an impossibility and that no opinion could be false &#8212;
      as one which had long embarrassed himself, and which formed the
      favourite subterfuge of the impostors whom he calls Sophists. He
      then states that this doctrine of the Sophists was founded on the
      Parmenidean dictum &#8212; That Non-Ens was an impossible supposition.
      Refuting the dictum of Parmenides (by a course of reasoning which
      I shall examine elsewhere), he arrives at the conclusion &#8212; That
      Non-Ens exists in a certain fashion, as well as Ens: That false
      opinions are possible: That there may be false opinions as well as
      true. But what deserves most notice here, in illustration of
      Plato&#8217;s manner, is &#8212; that though the Sophist&ecirc;s<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_142" href="#Footnotev3_28_142"><span
          class="sp">142</span></a> is announced as a continuation of
      the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (carried on by the same speakers, with
      the addition of the Eleate), yet the objections taken by Sokrates
      in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus against the possibility of false
      opinion, are not even noticed in the Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; much less
      removed. Other objections to it are propounded and dealt with: but
      not those objections which had arrested the march of Sokrates in
      the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus.<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_143"

      allude to those objections against his conclusion which had
      appeared to both of them irresistible in the preceding dialogue

        In the Sophist&ecirc;s, the Eleate establishes (to his own
        satisfaction) that &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; is not &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, but
        &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; (p. 257 B), that it is one &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; among the
        various &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951; (p. 260 B), and that it (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#8150;) enters

        &amp;c. It is therefore possible that there may be &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;
        or &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;, when you affirm, respecting any given subject,

        considers that the case is thus made out against the Sophist, as
        the impostor and dealer in falsehoods; false opinion being
        proved to be possible and explicable. </p>

        But if we turn to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (p. 189 seq.), we
        shall see that this very explication of &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; is there
        enunciated and impugned by Sokrates in a long argument. He calls
        it there &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#943;&#945;, &#7953;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#943;&#945;, &#964;&#8056; &#7953;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#949;&#8150;&#957; (pp. 189 A, 190
        E, 193 D). No man (he says) can mistake one thing for another;
        if this were so, he must be supposed both to know and not to
        know the same thing, which is impossible (pp. 196 A, 200 A).
        Therefore &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; is impossible. </p>
      <p>
        Of these objections, urged by Sokrates in the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, against the possibility of &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#943;&#945;, no
        notice is taken in the Sophist&ecirc;s either by Sokrates, or by
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, or by the Eleate in the Sophist&ecirc;s.
        Indeed the Eleate congratulates himself upon the explanation as
        more satisfactory than he had expected to find (p. 264 B): and
        speaks with displeasure of the troublesome persons who stir up
        doubts and contradictions (p. 259 C): very different from the
        tone of Sokrates in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (p. 195, B-C). </p>
      <p>
        I may farther remark that Plato, in the Republic, reasons about
        &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; in the Parmenidean sense, and not in the sense which he
        ascribed to it in the Sophist&ecirc;s, and which he recognises
        in the Politikus, p. 284 B. (Republic, v. pp. 477 A, 478 C.)</p>
      <p>
        Socher (Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, pp. 260-270) points out the
        discrepancy between the doctrines of the Eleate in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s, and those maintained by Sokrates in other
        Platonic dialogues; inferring from thence that the
        Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus are not compositions of Plato. As
        between the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and the Sophist&ecirc;s, I
        think a stronger case of discrepancy might be set forth than he
        has stated; though the end of the former is tied to the
        beginning of the latter plainly, directly, and intentionally.
        But I do not agree in his inference. He concludes that the
        Sophist&ecirc;s is not Plato&#8217;s composition: I conclude, that the
        scope for dissident views and doctrine, within the long
        philosophical career and numerous dialogues of Plato, is larger
        than his commentators admit.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_28_70"></a>Plato considered that the search for
        Truth was the noblest occupation of life.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such a string of objections never answered, and of difficulties
      without solution, may appear to many persons nugatory as well as
      tiresome. To Plato they did not appear so. At the time when
      most of his dialogues were composed, he considered that the Search
      after truth was at once the noblest occupation, and the highest
      pleasure, of life. Whoever has no sympathy with such a pursuit &#8212;
      whoever cares only for results, and finds the chase in itself
      fatiguing rather than attractive &#8212; is likely to take little
      interest in the Platonic dialogues. To repeat what I said in <a
        href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Sidenotev1_8_29">Chapter <span

      &#8212; Those who expect from Plato a coherent system in which
      affirmative dogmas are first to be laid down, with the evidence in
      their favour &#8212; next, the difficulties and objections against them
      enumerated &#8212; lastly, these difficulties solved &#8212; will be
      disappointed. Plato is, occasionally, abundant in his
      affirmations: he has also great negative fertility in starting
      objections: but the affirmative current does not come into
      conflict with the negative. His belief is enforced by rhetorical
      fervour, poetical illustration, and a vivid emotional fancy. These
      elements stand to him in the place of positive proof; and when his
      mind is full of them, the unsolved objections, which he himself
      had stated elsewhere, vanish out of sight. Towards the close of
      his life (as we shall see in the Treatise De Legibus), the love of
      dialectic, and the taste for enunciating difficulties even when he
      could not clear them up, died out within him. He becomes <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page183" id="v3page183"></a>183</span>ultra-dogmatical,
      losing even the poetical richness and fervour which had once
      marked his affirmations, and substituting in their place a strict
      and compulsory orthodoxy.</p>

      The contrast between the philosopher and the man engaged in active
      life &#8212; which is so emphatically set forth in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_144"

      falls in with the distinction between Knowledge and Opinion &#8212; The
      Infallible and the Fallible. It helps the purpose of the dialogue,
      to show what knowledge is <i>not</i>: and it presents the
      distinction between the two on the ethical and emotional side,
      upon which Plato laid great stress. The philosopher (or man of
      Knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> Knowledge viewed on its subjective side)
      stands opposed to the men of sensible perception and opinion, not
      merely in regard to intellect, but in regard to disposition,
      feeling, character, and appreciation of objects. He neither knows
      nor cares about particular things or particular persons: all his
      intellectual force, and all his emotional interests, are engaged
      in the contemplation of Universals or Real Entia, and of the great
      pervading cosmical forces. He despises the occupations of those
      around him, and the actualities of life, like the Platonic
      Sokrates in the Gorgias:<a name="FnAnchorv3_28_145"
        href="#Footnotev3_28_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a>
      assimilating himself as much as possible to the Gods; who have no
      other occupation (according to the Aristotelian<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_28_146" href="#Footnotev3_28_146"><span
          class="sp">146</span></a> Ethics), except that of
      contemplating and theorising. He pursues these objects not with a
      view to any ulterior result, but because the pursuit is in itself
      a life both of virtue and happiness; neither of which are to be
      found in the region of opinion. Intense interest in speculation is
      his prominent characteristic. To dwell amidst these contemplations
      is a self-sufficing life; even without any of the aptitudes or
      accomplishments admired by the practical men. If the philosopher
      meddles with their pursuits, he is not merely found incompetent,
      but also incurs general derision; because his incompetence becomes
      manifest even to the common-place citizens. But if <i>they</i>
      meddle with his speculations, they fail not less disgracefully;
      though their failure is not appreciated by the unphilosophical
      spectator.</p>

      from the professors of Opinion. And opinion itself &#8212; The Fallible

      talk about true and false opinions: but how can false opinions be

      as applied to opinions? Not only, therefore, opinion can never be

        is untenable (Prim. Commentat. in Hippokratis Prorrhetica, Tom.
        xvi. p. 487. ed. K&uuml;hn).</p>
      <p>
        Bonitz, in his Platonische Studien (pp. 41-78), has given an
        instructive analysis and discussion of the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. I find more to concur with in his views,
        than in those of Schleiermacher or Steinhart. He disputes
        altogether the assumption of other Platonic critics, that a
        purely negative result is unworthy of Plato; and that the
        negative apparatus is an artifice to recommend, and a veil to
        conceal, some great affirmative truth, which acute expositors
        can detect and enunciate plainly (Schleiermacher, Einleit. zum
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 124 seq.) Bonitz recognises the result
        of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus as purely negative, and vindicates
        the worth of it as such. Moreover, instead of denouncing the
        opinions which Plato combats, as if they were perverse heresies
        of dishonest pretenders, he adverts to the great difficulty of
        those problems which both Plato and Plato&#8217;s opponents undertook
        to elucidate: and he remarks that, in those early days, the
        first attempts to explain psychological phenomena were even more
        liable to error than the first attempts to explain physical
        phenomena (pp. 75-77). Such recognition, of the real difficulty
        of a problem, is rare among the Platonic critics.</p>

        dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>
      These two dialogues are both of them announced by Plato as forming
      sequel to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. The beginning of the
      Sophist&ecirc;s fits on to the end of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus:
      and the Politikus is even presented as a second part or
      continuation of the Sophist&ecirc;s.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_1"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In all the
      three, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page186"
          id="v3page186"></a>186</span>same interlocutors are partially
      maintained. Thus Sokrates, Theod&ocirc;rus, and
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus are present in all three: and
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus makes the responses, not only in the
      dialogue which bears his name, but also in the Sophist&ecirc;s.
      Both in the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, however, Sokrates
      himself descends from the part of principal speaker to that of
      listener: it is he, indeed, who by his question elicits the
      exposition, but he makes no comment either during the progress of
      it or at the close. In both the dialogues, the leading and
      expository function is confided to a new personage introduced by
      Theod&ocirc;rus:&#8212; a stranger not named, but announced as coming
      from Elea &#8212; the friend and companion of Parmenides and Zeno.
      Perhaps (remarks Sokrates) your friend may, without your
      knowledge, be a God under human shape; as Homer tells us that the
      Gods often go about, in the company of virtuous men, to inspect
      the good and bad behaviour of mankind. Perhaps your friend may be
      a sort of cross-examining God, coming to test and expose our
      feebleness in argument. No (replies Theod&ocirc;rus) that is not
      his character. He is less given to <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page187" id="v3page187"></a>187</span>dispute than his
      companions. He is far from being a God, but he is a divine man:
      for I call all true philosophers divine.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_2"

        At the beginning of the Politikus, Plato makes Sokrates refer
        both to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and to the Sophist&ecirc;s (p.
        258 A). In more than one passage of the Politikus (pp. 266 D,
        284 B, 286 B), he even refers to the Sophist&ecirc;s directly
        and by name, noticing certain points touched in it &#8212; a thing
        very unusual with him. In the Sophist&ecirc;s also (p. 233 B),
        express reference is made to a passage in the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus.</p>
      <p>
        See also the allusion in Sophist&ecirc;s (to the appearance of
        the younger Sokrates as respondent), p. 218 B.</p>
      <p>
        Socher (in his work, Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, pp. 258-294)
        maintains that neither the Sophist&ecirc;s, nor the Politikus,
        nor the Parmenid&ecirc;s, are genuine works of Plato. He
        conceives the two dialogues to be contemporary with the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (which he holds to have been written by
        Plato), but to have been composed by some acute philosopher of
        the Megaric school, conversant with the teachings of Sokrates
        and with the views of Plato, after the visit of the latter to
        Megara in the period succeeding the death of Sokrates (p. 268).</p>
      <p>
        Even if we grant the exclusion of Plato&#8217;s authorship, the
        hypothesis of an author belonging to the Megaric school is
        highly improbable: the rather, since many critics suppose (I
        think erroneously) that the Megarici are among those attacked in
        the dialogue. The suspicion that Plato is not the author of
        Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus has undoubtedly more appearance of
        reason than the same suspicion as applied to other dialogues &#8212;
        though I think the reasons altogether insufficient. Socher
        observes, justly: 1. That the two dialogues are peculiar,
        distinguished from other Platonic dialogues by the profusion of
        logical classification, in practice as well as in theory. 2.
        That both, and especially the Sophist&ecirc;s, advance
        propositions and conclusions discrepant from what we read in
        other Platonic dialogues. &#8212; But these two reasons are not
        sufficient to make me disallow them. I do not agree with those
        who require so much uniformity, either of matter or of manner,
        in the numerous distinct dialogues of Plato. I recognise a much
        wider area of admissible divergence.</p>
      <p>
        The plain announcement contained in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
        Sophist&ecirc;s, and Politikus themselves, that the two last are
        intended as sequel to the first, is in my mind a proof of
        sameness of authorship, not counterbalanced by Socher&#8217;s
        objections. Why should a Megaric author embody in his two
        dialogues a false pretence and assurance, that they are sequel
        of the Platonic The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus? Why should so acute a
        writer (as Socher admits him to be) go out of his way to
        suppress his own personality, and merge his fame in that of
        Plato? </p>
      <p>
        I make the same remark on the views of Suckow (Form der
        Platonischen Schriften, p. 87, seq., Breslau, 1855), who admits
        the Sophistes to be a genuine work of Plato, but declares the
        Politikus to be spurious; composed by some fraudulent author,
        who wished to give to his dialogue the false appearance of being
        a continuation of the Sophistes: he admits (p. 93) that it must
        be a deliberate deceit, if the Politikus be really the work of a
        different author from the Sophist&ecirc;s; for identity of
        authorship is distinctly affirmed in it. </p>
      <p>
        Suckow gives two reasons for believing that the Politikus is not
        by Plato:&#8212; 1. That the doctrines respecting government are
        different from those of the Republic, and the cosmology of the
        long mythe which it includes different from the cosmology of the
        Tim&aelig;us. These are reasons similar to those advanced by
        Socher, and (in my judgment) insufficient reasons. 2. That
        Aristotle, in a passage of the Politica (iv. 2, p. 1289, b. 5),
        alludes to an opinion, which is found in the Politikus in the
        following terms: &#7972;&#948;&#951; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#966;&#942;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;
        &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;, &amp;c. Suckow maintains that Aristotle could never have
        alluded to Plato in these terms, and that he must have believed
        the Politikus to be composed by some one else. But I think this
        inference is not justified by the premisses. It is noway
        impossible that Aristotle might allude to Plato sometimes in
        this vague and general way: and I think that he has done so in
        other passages of the same treatise (vii. 2, 1324, a. 29 &#8212; vii.
        7, p. 1327, b. 37). </p>
      <p>
        Ueberweg (Aechtheit der Platon. Schrift. p. 162, seq.) combats
        with much force the views of Suckow. It would be rash to build
        so much negative inference upon a loose phrase of Aristotle.
        That he should have spoken of Plato in this vague manner is much
        more probable, or much less improbable, than the
        counter-supposition, that the author of a striking and
        comprehensive dialogue, such as the Politikus, should have
        committed a fraud for the purpose of fastening his composition
        on Plato, and thus abnegating all fame for himself. </p>
      <p>
        The explicit affirmation of the Politikus itself ought to be
        believed, in my judgment, unless it can be refuted by greater
        negative probabilities than any which Socher and Suckow produce.
        I do not here repeat, what I have endeavoured to justify in an
        earlier <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40435/40435-h/40435-h.htm#Platovol1ch6">chapter</a> of this work, the confidence which I feel in the
        canon of Thrasyllus; a confidence which it requires stronger
        arguments than those of these two critics to overthrow.</p>

      This Eleate performs the whole task of exposition, by putting
      questions to The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, in the Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; to
      the younger Sokrates in the Politikus. Since the true Sokrates is
      merely listener in both dialogues, Plato provides for him an
      additional thread of connection with both; by remarking that the
      youthful Sokrates is his namesake, and that The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
      resembles him in flat nose and physiognomy.<a

        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus.</span></p>
    <p>
      Though Plato himself plainly designates the Sophist&ecirc;s as an
      intended sequel to the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, yet the method of
      the two is altogether different, and in a certain sense even
      opposite. In the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Sokrates extracts answers
      from the full and pregnant mind of that youthful respondent: he
      himself professes to teach nothing, but only to canvass every
      successive hypothesis elicited from his companion. But the Eleate
      is presented to us in the most imposing terms, as a thoroughly
      accomplished philosopher: coming with doctrines established in his
      mind,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_4" href="#Footnotev3_29_4"><span
          class="sp">4</span></a> and already practised in the task of
      exposition which Sokrates entreats him to undertake. He is, from
      beginning to end, affirmative and dogmatical: and if he declines
      to proceed by continuous lecture, this is only because he is
      somewhat ashamed to appropriate all the talk to himself.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_5" href="#Footnotev3_29_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
      He therefore prefers to accept The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus as
      respondent. But The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is no longer pregnant, as in
      the preceding dialogue. He can do no more than give answers
      signifying assent and dissent, which merely serve to break and
      diversify the exposition. In fact, the dialogue in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus is assimilated by Plato himself,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_6" href="#Footnotev3_29_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
      not to that in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, but to that in the last
      half of the Parmenides; wherein Aristotel&ecirc;s the respondent
      answers little more than Ay or No, to leading questions from the
      interrogator.</p>

        Plato, Sophist. p. 217 C. The words of Sokrates show that he
        alludes to the last half of the Parmenid&ecirc;s, in which he is
        only present as a listener &#8212; not to the first half, in which he
        takes an active part. Compare the Parmenid&ecirc;s, p. 137 C. In
        this last-mentioned dialogue, Sokrates (then a youth) and
        Aristotel&ecirc;s are the parallel of The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and
        the younger Sokrates in the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus. (See

    <p>
      In noticing the circumlocutory character, and multiplied negative
      criticism, of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, without any ultimate
      profit realised in the form of positive result &#8212; I remarked, that
      Plato appreciated dialogues, not merely as the road to a
      conclusion, but for the mental discipline and suggestive influence
      of the tentative and verifying process. It was his purpose to
      create in his hearers a disposition to prosecute philosophical
      research of their own, and at the same time to strengthen their
      ability of doing so with effect. This remark is confirmed by the
      two dialogues now before us, wherein Plato defends himself against
      reproaches seemingly made to him at the time.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_7" href="#Footnotev3_29_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
      &#8220;To what does all this tend? Why do you stray so widely from your
      professed topic? Could you not have reached this point by a
      shorter road?&#8221; He replies by distinctly proclaiming &#8212; That the
      process, with its improving influence on the mind, stands first in
      his thoughts &#8212; the direct conclusion of the enquiry, only second:
      That the special topic which he discusses, though in itself
      important, is nevertheless chosen principally with a view to its
      effect in communicating general method and dialectic aptitude:
      just as a schoolmaster, when he gives out to his pupils a word to
      be spelt, looks mainly, not to their exactness in spelling that
      particular word, but to their command of good spelling generally.<a

      To form inquisitive, testing minds, fond of philosophical debate
      as a pursuit, and looking at opinions on the negative as well as
      on the positive side, is the first object in most of Plato&#8217;s
      dialogues: to teach positive truth, is only a secondary object.</p>

    <p>
      Both the Sophistes and the Politikus are lessons and specimens of
      that process which the logical manuals recognise under the names &#8212;
      Definition and Division. What is a Sophist? What is a politician
      or statesman? What is a philosopher? In the first place &#8212; Are the
      three really distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page189"

      doubtful: since the true philosopher, in his visits of inspection

      public, and confounded with the other two.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_9" href="#Footnotev3_29_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
      The Eleate replies that the three are distinct. Then what is the
      characteristic function of each? How is he distinguished from
      other persons or other things? To what class or classes does each
      belong: and what is the specific character belonging to the class,
      so as to mark its place in the scheme descending by successive
      logical subdivision from the highest genus down to particulars?
      What other professions or occupations are there analogous to those

        Bisecting division.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such are the problems which it is the direct purpose of the two
      dialogues before us to solve. But a large proportion of both is
      occupied by matters bearing only indirectly upon the solution. The
      process of logical subdivision, or the formation of classes in
      subordination to each other, can be exhibited just as plainly in
      application to an ordinary craft or profession, as to one of grave
      importance. The Eleate Stranger even affirms that the former case
      will be simpler, and will serve as explanatory introduction to the
      latter.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_10" href="#Footnotev3_29_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> He therefore selects the craft of an
      angler, for which to find a place in logical classification. Does
      not an angler belong to the general class &#8212; men of art or craft?
      He is not a mere artless, non-professional, private man. This
      being so, we must distribute the class Arts &#8212; Artists, into two
      subordinate classes: Artists who construct or put together some
      new substance or compound &#8212; Artists who construct nothing new, but
      are employed in getting, or keeping, or employing, substances
      already made. Thus the class Artists is bisected into Constructive
      &#8212; Acquisitive. The angler constructs nothing: he belongs to the
      acquisitive branch. We now bisect this latter branch. Acquirers
      either obtain by consent, or appropriate without consent. Now the
      angler is one of the last-mentioned class: which is again bisected
      into two sub-classes, according as <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page190" id="v3page190"></a>190</span>the
      appropriation is by force or stratagem &#8212; Fighters and Hunters. The
      angler is a hunter: but many other persons are hunters also, from
      whom he must be distinguished. Hunters are therefore divided into,
      Those who hunt inanimate things (such as divers for sponges,
      &amp;c.), and Those who hunt living things or animals, including
      of course the angler among them. The hunters of animals are
      distinguished into hunters of walking animals, and hunters of
      swimming animals. Of the swimming animals some are in air, others
      in water:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_11" href="#Footnotev3_29_11"><span
          class="sp">11</span></a> hence we get two classes,
      Bird-Hunters and Fish-Hunters; to the last of whom the angler
      belongs. The fish-hunters (or fishermen) again are bisected into
      two classes, according as they employ nets, or striking
      instruments of one kind or another, such as tridents, &amp;c. Of
      the striking fishermen there are two sorts: those who do their
      work at night by torch-light, and those who work by day. All these
      day-fishermen, including among them the angler, use instruments
      with hooks at the end. But we must still make one bisection more.
      Some of them employ tridents, with which they strike from above
      downwards at the fishes, upon any part of the body which may
      present itself: others use hooks, rods, and lines, which they
      contrive to attach to the jaws of the fish, and thereby draw him
      from below upward.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_12"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> This is
      the special characteristic of the angler. We have now a class
      comprehending the anglers alone, so that no farther sub-division
      is required. We have obtained not merely the name of the angler,
      but also the rational explanation of the function to which the
      name is attached.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_13"

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_6"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_6"></a>Such a lesson in logical
        classification was at that time both novel and instructive. No
        logical manuals then existed.</span></p>
    <p>
      This is the first specimen which Plato gives of a systematic
      classification descending, by successive steps of bifurcation,
      through many subordinations of genera and species, each founded on
      a real and proclaimed distinction &#8212; and ending at last in an <i>infima
        species</i>. He repeats the like process in regard to the
      Sophist, the Statesman, and other professions to which he compares
      the one or the other: but it will suffice to have <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page191" id="v3page191"></a>191</span>given
      one specimen of his method. If we transport ourselves back to his
      time, I think that such a view of the principles of classification
      implies a new and valuable turn of thought. There existed then no
      treatises on logic; no idea of logic as a scheme of mental
      procedure; no sciences out of which it was possible to abstract
      the conception of a regular method more or less diversified. On no
      subject was there any mass of facts or details collected, large
      enough to demand some regular system for the purpose of arranging
      and rendering them intelligible. Classification to a certain
      extent is of necessity involved, consciously or unconsciously, in
      the use of general terms. But the process itself had never been
      made a subject of distinct consciousness or reflection to any one
      (as far as our knowledge reaches), in the time of Plato. No one
      had yet looked at it as a process natural indeed to the human
      intellect, up to a certain point and in a loose manner, &#8212; but
      capable both of great extension and great improvement, and
      requiring especial study, with an end deliberately set before the
      mind, in order that it might be employed with advantage to
      regularise and render intelligible even common and well-known
      facts. To determine a series of descending classes, with
      class-names, each connoting some assignable characteristic &#8212; to
      distribute the whole of each class between two correlative
      sub-classes, to compare the different ways in which this could be
      done, and to select such <i>membra condividentia</i> as were most
      suitable for the purpose &#8212; this was in the time of Plato an
      important novelty. We know from Xenophon<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_14"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> that
      Sokrates considered Dialectic to be founded, both etymologically
      and really, upon the distribution of particular things into genera
      or classes. But we find little or no intentional illustration of
      this process in any of the conversations of the Xenophontic
      Sokrates: and we are farther struck by the fact that Plato, in the
      two dialogues which we are here considering, assigns all the
      remarks on the process of classification, not to Sokrates himself,
      but to the nameless Eleatic Stranger.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_29_7"></a>Plato describes the Sophist as
        analogous to an angler. He traces the Sophist by descending
        subdivision from the acquisitive genus of art.</span></p>
    <p>
      After giving the generic deduction of the angler from the
      comprehensive idea of Art, distributed into two sections,
      constructive and acquisitive, Plato proceeds to notice <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page192" id="v3page192"></a>192</span>the
      analogy between the Sophist and an angler: after which he deduces
      the Sophist also from the acquisitive section of Art. The Sophist
      is an angler for rich young men.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_15"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> To find
      his place in the preceding descending series, we must take our
      departure from the bisection &#8212; hunters of walking animals, hunters
      of swimming animals. The Sophist is a hunter of walking animals:
      which may be divided into two classes, wild and tame. The Sophist
      hunts a species of tame animals &#8212; men. Hunters of tame animals are
      bisected into such as hunt by violent means (robbers, enslavers,
      despots, &amp;c.),<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_16"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> and such
      as hunt by persuasive means. Of the hunters by means of persuasion
      there are two kinds: those who hunt the public, and those who hunt
      individuals. The latter again may be divided into two classes:
      those who hunt to their own loss, by means of presents, such as
      lovers, &amp;c., and those who hunt with a view to their own
      profit. To this latter class belongs the Sophist: pretending to
      associate with others for the sake of virtue, but really looking
      to his own profit.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_17"

        It illustrates the sentiment of Plato&#8217;s age respecting

    <p>
      Again, we may find the Sophist by descending through a different
      string of subordinate classes from the genus &#8212; <i>Acquisitive Art</i>.
      The professors of this latter may be bisected into two sorts &#8212;
      hunters and exchangers. Exchangers are of two sorts &#8212; givers and
      sellers. Sellers again sell either their own productions, or the
      productions of others. Those who sell the productions of others
      are either fixed residents in one city, or hawkers travelling
      about from city to city. Hawkers again carry about for sale either
      merchandise for the body, or merchandise for the mind, such as
      music, poetry, painting, exhibitions of jugglery, learning, and
      intellectual accomplishments, and so forth. These latter (hawkers
      for the mind) may be divided into two sorts: <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page193" id="v3page193"></a>193</span>those
      who go about teaching; for money, arts and literary
      accomplishments &#8212; and those who go about teaching virtue for
      money. They who go about teaching virtue for money are the
      Sophists.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_18" href="#Footnotev3_29_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> Or indeed if they sell virtue and
      knowledge for money, they are not the less Sophists &#8212; whether they

      whether they remain in one city or become itinerant.</p>

    <p>
      A third series of subordinate classes will also bring us down from
      the genus &#8212; <i>Acquisitive Art</i> &#8212; down to the <i>infima
        species</i> &#8212; <i>Sophist</i>. In determining the class-place of
      the angler, we recognised a bisection of acquisitive art into
      acquirers by exchange, or mutual consent &#8212; and acquirers by
      appropriation, or without consent.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_19"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> These
      latter we divided according as they employed either force or
      stratagem: contenders and hunters. We then proceeded to bisect the
      class hunters, leaving the contenders without farther notice. Now
      let us take up the class contenders. It may be divided into two:
      competitors for a set prize (pecuniary or honorary), and fighters.
      The fighters go to work either body against body, violently &#8212; or
      tongue against tongue, as arguers. These arguers again fall into
      two classes: the pleaders, who make long speeches, about just or
      unjust, before the public assembly and dikastery: and the
      dialogists, who meet each other in short question and answer. The
      dialogists again are divided into two: the private, untrained
      antagonists, quarrelling with each other about the particular
      affairs of life (who form a species by themselves, since
      characteristic attributes may be assigned to them; though these
      attributes are too petty and too indefinite to have ever received
      a name in common language, or to deserve a name from us<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_20" href="#Footnotev3_29_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a>) &#8212; and the trained practitioners or
      wranglers, who dispute not about particular incidents, but about
      just and unjust in general, and <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page194" id="v3page194"></a>194</span>other general
      matters.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_21" href="#Footnotev3_29_21"><span
          class="sp">21</span></a> Of wranglers again there are two
      sorts: the prosers, who follow the pursuit from spontaneous taste
      and attachment, not only without hope of gain, but to the
      detriment of their private affairs, incurring loss themselves, and
      wearying or bothering their hearers: and those who make money by
      such private dialogues. This last sort of wrangler is the Sophist.<a

        genus of separating or discriminating art.</span></p>
    <p>
      There is yet another road of class-distribution which will bring
      us down to the Sophist. A great number of common arts (carding
      wool, straining through a sieve, &amp;c.) have, in common, the
      general attribute of separating matters confounded in a heap. Of
      separation there are two sorts: you may separate like from like
      (this has no established name) &#8212; or better from worse, which is
      called <i>purification</i>. Purification is of two sorts: either
      of body or of mind. In regard to body, the purifying agents are
      very multifarious, comprising not only men and animals, but also
      inanimate things: and thus including many varieties which in
      common estimation are mean, trivial, repulsive, or ludicrous. But
      all these various sentiments (observes Plato) we must disregard.
      We must follow out a real analogy wherever it leads us, and
      recognise a logical affinity wherever we find one; whether the
      circumstances brought together be vile or venerable, or some of
      them vile and some venerable, in the eyes of mankind. Our sole
      purpose is to improve our intelligence. With that view, all

        vulgar items deserve as much attention as grand ones. Conflict
        between emotional and scientific classification.</span></p>
    <p>
      This precept (repeated by Plato also in the Politikus) respecting
      the principles of classification, deserves notice. It protests
      against, and seeks to modify, one of the ordinary turns in the
      associating principles of the human mind. With unreflecting men,
      classification is often emotional rather than intellectual. The
      groups of objects thrown together in such minds, and conceived in
      immediate association, are such as suggest the same or kindred
      emotions: pleasure or pain, love or hatred, hope or fear,
      admiration, contempt, disgust, jealousy, ridicule. Community of
      emotion is a stronger bond of association between different
      objects, than community in any attribute not immediately
      interesting to the emotions, and appreciable only intellectually.
      Thus objects which have nothing else in common, except appeal to
      the same earnest emotion, will often be called by the same general
      name, and will be constituted members of the same class. To attend
      to attributes in any other point of view than in reference to the
      amount and kind of emotion which they excite, is a process
      uncongenial to ordinary taste: moreover, if any one brings
      together, in the same wording, objects really similar, but
      exciting opposite and contradictory emotions, he usually provokes
      either disgust or ridicule. All generalizations, and all general
      terms connoting them, are results brought together by association
      and comparison of particulars somehow resembling. But if we look
      at the process of association in an unreflecting person, the
      resemblances which it fastens upon will be often emotional, not
      intellectual: and the generalizations founded upon such
      resemblances will be emotional also.</p>
    <p>
      It is against this natural propensity that Plato here enters his
      protest, in the name of intellect and science. For the purpose of
      obtaining a classification founded on real, intrinsic affinities,
      we <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page196" id="v3page196"></a>196</span>must
      exclude all reference to the emotions: we must take no account
      whether a thing be pleasing or hateful, sublime or mean:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_24" href="#Footnotev3_29_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> we must bring ourselves to rank
      objects useful or grand in the same logical compartment with
      objects hurtful or ludicrous. We must examine only whether the
      resemblance is true and real, justifying itself to the comparing
      intellect: and whether the class-term chosen be such as to
      comprise all these resemblances, holding them apart (&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#967;&#941;&#964;&#969;
      &#967;&#969;&#961;&#8054;&#962;) from the correlative and opposing class.<a

        Compare Politikus, p. 266 D; Parmenid&ecirc;s, p. 130 E.</p>
      <p>
        We see that Plato has thus both anticipated and replied to the
        objection of Socher (Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, pp. 260-262), who
        is displeased with the minuteness of this classification, and
        with the vulgar objects to which it is applied. Socher contends
        that this is unworthy of Plato, and that it was peculiar to the
        subtle Megaric philosophers.</p>
      <p>
        I think, on the contrary, that the purpose of illustrating the
        process of classification was not unworthy of Plato; that it was
        not unnatural to do this by allusion to vulgar trades or
        handicraft, at a time when no scientific survey of physical
        facts had been attempted; that the allusion to such vulgar
        trades is quite in the manner of Plato, and of Sokrates before
        him.</p>
      <p>
        Stallbaum, in his elaborate Prolegomena both to the
        Sophist&ecirc;s and to the Politikus, rejects the conclusion of
        Socher, and maintains that both dialogues are the work of Plato.
        Yet he agrees to a certain extent in Socher&#8217;s premisses. He
        thinks that minuteness and over-refinement in classification
        were peculiarities of the Megaric philosophers, and that Plato
        intentionally pushes the classification into an extreme subtlety
        and minuteness, in order to parody their proceedings and turn
        them into ridicule. (Proleg. ad Sophist. pp. 32-36, ad Politic.
        pp. 54-55.)</p>
      <p>
        But how do Socher and Stallbaum know that this extreme
        minuteness of subdivision into classes <i>was</i> a
        characteristic of the Megaric philosophers? Neither of them
        produce any proof of it. Indeed Stallbaum himself says, most
        truly (Proleg. ad Politic. p. 55) &#8220;Qu&aelig; de Megaricorum arte
        dialectic&acirc; accepimus, sane quam sunt paucissima&#8221;. He might
        have added, that the little which we do hear about their
        dialectic, is rather adverse to this supposed minuteness of
        positive classification, than consonant with it. What we hear
        is, that they were extremely acute and subtle in contentious
        disputations &#8212; able assailants of the position of a logical
        opponent. But this talent has nothing to do with minuteness of
        positive classification: and is even indicative of a different
        turn of mind. Moreover, we hear about Eukleides, the chief of
        the Megaric school, that he enlarged the signification of the
        Summum Genus of Parmenides &#8212; the &#7963;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#928;&#8118;&#957;. Eukleides called it
        Unum, Bonum, Simile et Idem Semper, Deus, &amp;c. But we do not
        hear that Eukleides acknowledged a series of subordinate Genera
        or Species, expanding by logical procession below this primary
        Unum. As far as we can judge, this seems to have been wanting in
        his philosophy. Yet it is exactly these subordinate Genera or
        Species, which the Platonic Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus supply
        in abundance, and even excess, conformably to the precept laid
        down by Plato in the Phil&ecirc;bus (p. 14). The words of the
        Sophist&ecirc;s (p. 216 D) rather indicate that the Eleatic
        Stranger is declared <i>not</i> to possess the character and
        attributes of Megaric disputation.</p>

        Though the advice here given by Plato about the principles of
        classification is very judicious, yet he has himself in this
        same dialogue set an example of repugnance to act upon it
        (Sophist. p. 231 A-B.) In following out his own descending
        series of partitions, he finds that the Sophist corresponds with
        the great mental purifier &#8212; the person who applies the Elenchus
        or cross-examining test, to youthful minds, so as to clear out
        that false persuasion of knowledge which is the great bar to all
        improvement. But though brought by his own process to this
        point, Plato shrinks from admitting it. His dislike towards the
        Sophist will not allow him. &#8220;The Sophist is indeed&#8221; (he says)
        &#8220;very like to this grand educator: but so also a wolf is very
        like to a dog &#8212; the most savage of animals to the most gentle.
        We must always be extremely careful about these likenesses: the
        whole body of them are most slippery. Still we cannot help
        admitting the Sophist to represent this improving process &#8212; that
        is, the high and true bred Sophist.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        It will be seen that Plato&#8217;s remark here about &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#962;
        contradicts what he had himself said before (p. 227 B). The
        reluctance to rank <i>dog</i> and <i>wolf</i> together, in the
        same class, is an exact specimen of that very mistake which he
        had been just pointing out for correction. The scientific
        resemblance between the two animals is very close; but the
        antithesis of sentiment, felt by men towards the one and the
        other, is extreme.</p>

      After these just remarks on classification generally, the Eleate
      pursues the subdivision of his own theme. To purify the mind is to
      get rid of the evil, and retain or improve the good. Now evil is

      disability, in the body, which it is the business of the gymnastic

        worst mode of evil. Cross-examination, the shock of the
        Elenchus, must be brought to bear upon it. This is the sovereign
        purifier.</span></p>
    <p>
      To meet this special and gravest case of ignorance, we must
      recognise a special division of the art of instruction or
      education. Exhortation, which is the common mode of instruction,
      and which was employed by our forefathers universally, is of no
      avail against this false persuasion of knowledge: which can only
      be approached and cured by the Elenchus, or philosophical
      cross-examination. So long as a man believes himself to be wise,
      you may lecture for ever without making impression upon him: you
      do no good by supplying food when the stomach is sick. But the
      examiner, questioning him upon those subjects which he professes
      to know, soon entangles him in contradictions with himself, making
      him feel with shame and humiliation his own <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page198" id="v3page198"></a>198</span>real ignorance.
      After having been thus disabused &#8212; a painful but indispensable
      process, not to be accomplished except by the Elenchus &#8212; his mind
      becomes open and teachable, so that positive instruction may be
      communicated to him with profit. The Elenchus is the grand and
      sovereign purification: whoever has not been subjected to it, were
      he even the Great King, is impure, unschooled, and incompetent for
      genuine happiness.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_28"

      Elenchus, the great Sokratic accomplishment and mission, to be
      shared by the Sophists: and he finds or makes a subtle distinction
      to keep them off. The Sophist (so the Eleate proceeds) is a
      disputant, and teaches all his youthful pupils to dispute about
      everything as if they knew it &#8212; about religion, astronomy,
      philosophy, arts, laws, politics, and everything else. He teaches
      them to argue in each department against the men of special
      science: he creates a belief in the minds of others that he really
      knows all those different subjects, respecting which he is able to
      argue and cross-examine successfully: he thus both possesses, and

        Plato, Sophist. pp. 232-233 C, 235 A. Sokrates tells us in the
        Platonic Apology (p. 23 A) that this was the exact effect which
        his own cross-examination produced upon the hearers: they
        supposed him to be wise on those topics on which he exposed
        ignorance in others. The Memorabilia of Xenophon exhibit the
        same impression as made by the conversation of Sokrates, even
        when he talked with artisans on their own arts. Sokrates indeed
        professed not to teach anyone &#8212; and he certainly took no fee for
        teaching. But we see plainly that this disclaimer imposed upon
        no one; that he did teach, though gratuitously; and that what he
        taught was, the art of cross-examination and dispute. We learn
        this not merely from his enemy, Aristophanes, and from the
        proceedings of his opponents, Kritias and Charikles (Xenoph.
        Memor. i. 2), but also from his own statement in the Platonic
        Apology (pp. 23 C. 37 E. 39 B), and from the language of Plato
        and Xenophon throughout. Plato is here puzzled to make out a
        clear line of distinction between the Elenchus of Sokrates, and
        the disputatious arguments of those Sophists whom he calls
        Eristic &#8212; name deserved quite as much by Sokrates as by any of
        them. Plato here accuses the Sophists of talking upon a great
        many subjects which they did not know, and teaching their pupils
        to do the same. This is exactly what Sokrates passed his life in
        doing, and what he did better than any one &#8212; on the negative
        side.</p>

      Here however (continues Plato) we are involved in a difficulty.
      How can a thing appear to be what it is not? How can a man who
      opines or affirms, opine or affirm falsely &#8212; that is, opine or
      affirm the thing that is not? To admit this, we must assume the
      thing that is not (or Non-Ens, Nothing) to have a real existence.
      Such an assumption involves great and often debated difficulties.
      It has been pronounced by Parmenides altogether inadmissible.<a

      We have already seen that Plato discussed this same question in
      the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, and that after trying and rejecting
      many successive hypotheses to show how false supposition, or false
      affirmation, might be explained as possible, by a theory involving
      no contradiction, he left the question unsolved. He now resumes it
      at great length. It occupies more than half<a

        problem by a series of questions.</span></p>
    <p>
      First, the Eleate states the opinion which perplexes him, and
      which he is anxious either to refute or to explain away.
      (Unfortunately, we have no statement of the opinion, nor of the
      grounds on which it was held, from those who actually held it.)
      Non-Ens, or Nothing, is not the name of any existing thing, or of
      any Something. But every one who speaks must speak something:
      therefore if you try to speak of Non-Ens, you are trying to speak
      nothing &#8212; which is equivalent to not speaking at all.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_34" href="#Footnotev3_29_34"><span
          class="sp">34</span></a> Moreover, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page200" id="v3page200"></a>200</span>to every
      Something, you can add something farther: but to Non-Ens, or
      Nothing, you cannot add any thing. (Non-Entis nulla sunt
      pr&aelig;dicata.) Now Number is something, or included among the
      Entia: you cannot therefore apply number, either singular or
      plural, to Non-Ens: and inasmuch as every thing conceived or
      described must be either one or many, it is impossible either to
      conceive or describe Non-Ens. You cannot speak of it without
      falling into a contradiction.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_35"

        Plato, Sophist. p. 237 E. The Eleate here recites this opinion,
        not as his own but as entertained by others, and as one which he
        did not clearly see through: in Republic (v. p. 478 B-C) we find
        Sokrates advancing a similar doctrine as his own. So in the
        Kratylus, where this same topic is brought under discussion (pp.
        429 D, 430 A), Kratylus is represented as contending that false
        propositions were impossible: that propositions, improperly
        called false, were in reality combinations of sounds without any
        meaning, like the strokes on a bell.</p>

        definition and escape, by affirming that to speak falsely is
        impossible. He will require us to make out a rational theory,
        explaining Non-Ens.</span></p>
    <p>
      When therefore we characterise the Sophist as one who builds up
      phantasms for realities &#8212; who presents to us what is not, as being
      like to what <i>is</i>, and as a false substitute for what <i>is</i>
      &#8212; he will ask us what we mean? If, to illustrate our meaning, we
      point to images of things in mirrors or clear water, he will
      pretend to be blind, and will refuse the evidence of sense: he
      will require us to make out a rational theory explaining Non-Ens
      or Nothing.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_36" href="#Footnotev3_29_36"><span
          class="sp">36</span></a> But when we try to do this, we
      contradict ourselves. A phantasm is that which, not being a true
      counterpart of reality, is yet so like it as to be mistaken for
      reality. <i>Quatenus</i> phantasm, it is Ens: <i>quatenus</i>
      reality, it is Non-Ens: thus the same thing is both Ens, and
      Non-Ens: which we declared before to be impossible.<a

      of passing off phantasms for realities, we suppose falsely: we
      suppose matters not existing, or contrary to those which exist: we
      suppose the existent not to exist, or the non-existent to exist
      But this assumes as done what cannot be done: since we have
      admitted more than once that Non-Ens can neither be described in
      language by itself, nor joined on in any manner to Ens.<a

      Stating the case in this manner, we find that to suppose falsely,
      or affirm falsely, is a contradiction. But there is yet another
      possible way out of the difficulty (the Eleate continues).</p>

    <p>
      Let us turn for a moment (he says) from Non-Ens to Ens. <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page201" id="v3page201"></a>201</span>The
      various physical philosophers tell us a good deal about Ens. They
      differ greatly among themselves. Some philosophers represent Ens
      as triple, comprising three distinct elements, sometimes in
      harmony, sometimes at variance with each other. Others tell us
      that it is double &#8212; wet and dry &#8212; or hot and cold. A third sect,
      especially Xenophanes and Parmenides, pronounce it to be
      essentially One. Herakleitus blends together the different
      theories, affirming that Ens is both many and one, always in
      process of disjunction and conjunction: Empedokles adopts a
      similar view, only dropping the <i>always</i>, and declaring the
      process of disjunction to alternate with that of conjunction, so
      that Ens is sometimes Many, sometimes One.<a

    <p>
      Now when I look at these various theories (continues the Eleate),
      I find that I do not follow or understand them; and that I know
      nothing more or better about Ens than about Non-Ens. I thought, as
      a young man, that I understood both: but I now find that I
      understand neither.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_40"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> The
      difficulties about Ens are just as great as those about Non-Ens.
      What do these philosophers mean by saying that Ens is double or
      triple? that there are two distinct existing elements &#8212; Hot and
      Cold &#8212; or three? What do you mean by saying that Hot and Cold <i>exist</i>?
      Is existence any thing distinct from Hot and Cold? If so, then
      there are three elements in all, not two. Do you mean that
      existence is something belonging to both and affirmed of both?
      Then you pronounce both to be One: and Ens, instead of being
      double, will be at the bottom only One.</p>

      Such are the questions which the Eleatic spokesman of Plato puts
      to those philosophers who affirm Ens to be plural: He turns next
      to those who affirm Ens to be singular, or Unum. Do you mean that
      Unum is identical with Ens &#8212; and are they only two names for the
      same One and only thing? There cannot be two distinct names
      belonging to one and the same thing: and yet, if this be not so,
      one of the names must be the name of nothing. At any rate, if
      there be only one name and one thing, still the name itself is <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page202" id="v3page202"></a>202</span>different
      from the thing &#8212; so that duality must still be recognised. Or if
      you take the name as identical with the One thing, it will either
      be the name of nothing, or the name of a name.<a

    <p>
      Again, as to the Whole:&#8212; is the Whole the same with the Ens Unum,
      or different from it. We shall be told that it is the same: but
      according to the description given by Parmenides, the whole is
      spherical, thus having a centre and circumference, and of course
      having parts. Now a whole divisible into parts may have unity
      predicable of it, as an affection or accident in respect to the
      sum of its parts: but it cannot be the genuine, essential,
      self-existent, One, which does not admit of parts or division. If
      Ens be One by accident, it is not identical with One, and we thus
      have two existent things: and if Ens be not really and essentially
      the Whole, while nevertheless the Whole exists &#8212; Ens must fall
      short of or be less than itself, and must to this extent be
      Non-Ens: besides that Ens, and Totum, being by nature distinct, we
      have more things than One existing. On the other hand, if we
      assume Totum not to be Ens, the same result will ensue. Ens will
      still be something less than itself; &#8212; Ens can never have any
      quantity, for each quantum is necessarily a whole in itself &#8212; and
      Ens can never be generated, since everything generated is also
      necessarily a whole.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_42"

    <p>
      Such is the examination which the Eleate bestows on the theories
      of theories of those philosophers who held one, two, or a definite
      number of self-existent Entia or elements. His purpose is to show,
      that even on their schemes, Ens is just as unintelligible, and
      involves as many contradictions, as Non-Ens. And to complete the
      same demonstration, he proceeds to dissect the theories of those
      who do not recognise any definite or specific number of elements
      or Entia.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_43" href="#Footnotev3_29_43"><span

      existing except what is tangible; defining Essence as identical
      with Body, and denying all incorporeal essence. Plato mentions no
      names: but he means (according to some commentators) Leukippus and
      Demokritus &#8212; perhaps Aristippus also. Secondly, other philosophers
      who, diametrically opposed to the Materialists, affirmed that
      there were no real Entia except certain Forms, Ideas, genera or
      species, incorporeal and conceivable only by intellect: that true
      and real essence was not to be found in those bodies wherein the
      Materialists sought it: that bodies were in constant generation
      and disappearance, affording nothing more than a transitory
      semblance of reality, not tenable<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_45"

    <p>
      The Eleate proceeds to comment upon the doctrines held by these
      opposing schools of thinkers respecting Essence or Reality. It is
      easier (he says) to deal with the last-mentioned, for they are
      more gentle. With the Materialists it is difficult, and all but
      impossible, to deal at all. Indeed, before we can deal with them,
      we must assume them to be for this occasion better than they show
      themselves in reality, and ready to answer in a more becoming
      manner than they actually do.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_46"

      is just, prudent, &amp;c., another is unjust and imprudent. One
      man is just, through the habit and presence of justice: another is

      Probably (replies The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus) these philosophers would
      contend that the soul or mind had a body; but they would be
      ashamed either to deny that justice, prudence, &amp;c., existed as
      realities &#8212; or to affirm that justice, prudence, &amp;c. were all
      bodies.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_48" href="#Footnotev3_29_48"><span

      become better (rejoins the Eleate): for the primitive and genuine
      leaders of them will not concede even so much as that. But let us
      accept the concession. If they will admit any incorporeal reality
      at all, however small, our case is made out. For we shall next
      call upon them to say, what there is in common between these
      latter, and those other realities which have bodies connate with
      and essential to them &#8212; to justify the names <i>real</i> &#8212; <i>essence</i>

      they would accept the following definition of Ens or the Real &#8212; of

      else, be it only for once or to the smallest degree &#8212; every such
      thing is true and real Ens. The characteristic mark or definition
      of Ens or the Real is, power or potentiality.<a

        undergoes change. Ens includes both the unchangeable and the

    <p>
      <i>No</i> &#8212; these philosophers will reply &#8212; we do not admit your
      definition as a definition of Ens: it applies only to the
      generated. Generation does involve, or emanate from, a reciprocity
      of agent and patient: but neither power nor action, nor suffering,
      have any application to Ens or the Real. But you admit (says the
      Eleate) that the mind knows Ens:&#8212; and that Ens is known by the
      mind. Now this <i>knowing</i>, is it not an action &#8212; and is not
      the <i>being known</i>, a passion? If <i>to know</i> is an
      action, then Ens, being known, is acted upon, suffers something,
      or undergoes some change, &#8212; which would be impossible if we assume
      Ens to be eternally unchanged. These philosophers might reply,
      that they do not admit <i>to know</i> as an action, nor <i>to be
        known</i> as a passion. They affirm Ens to be eternally
      unchanged, and they hold to their other affirmation that Ens is
      known by the mind. But (urges the Eleate) can they really believe
      that Ens is eternally the same and unchanged, &#8212; that it has
      neither life, nor mind, nor intelligence, nor change, nor
      movement? This is incredible. They must concede that Change, and
      the Changeable, are to be reckoned as Entia or Realities: for if
      these be not so reckoned, and if all Entia are unchangeable, no
      Ens can be an object of knowledge to any mind. But though the
      changeable belongs to Ens, we must not affirm that <i>all</i> Ens
      is changeable. There cannot be either intellect or knowledge,
      without something constant and unchangeable. It is equally
      necessary to recognise <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page206"
          id="v3page206"></a>206</span>something as constant and
      unchangeable &#8212; something else as moving and changeable: Ens or
      reality includes alike one and the other. The true philosopher
      therefore cannot agree with those &#8220;Friends of Forms&#8221; who affirm
      all Ens or Reality to be at rest and unchangeable, either under
      one form or under many:&#8212; still less can he agree with those
      opposite reasoners, who maintain all reality to be in perpetual
      change and movement. He will acknowledge both and each &#8212; rest and
      motion &#8212; the constant and the changeable &#8212; as making up together
      total reality or Ens Totum.</p>

        &#8212; distinct from both. But how can anything be distinct from
        both?</span></p>
    <p>
      Still, however, we have not got over our difficulties. Motion and
      Rest are contraries; yet we say that each and both are Realities
      or Entia. In what is it that they both agree? Not in moving, nor
      in being at rest, but simply in existence or reality. Existence or
      reality therefore must be a <i>tertium quid</i>, apart from
      motion and rest, not the sum total of those two items. Ens or the
      Real is not, in its own proper nature, either in motion or at
      rest, but is distinct from both. Yet how can this be? Surely,
      whatever is not in motion, must be at rest &#8212; whatever is not at
      rest, must be in motion. How can any thing be neither in motion
      nor at rest; standing apart from both?<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_52"

    <p>
      Let us try (he proceeds) another path. We know that it is a common
      practice in our daily speech to apply many different predicates to
      one and the same subject. We say of the same man, that he is fair,
      tall, just, brave, &amp;c., and several other epithets. Some
      persons deny our right to do this. They say that the predicate
      ought always to be identical with <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page207" id="v3page207"></a>207</span>the subject:
      that we can only employ with propriety such propositions as the
      following &#8212; man is man &#8212; good is good, &amp;c.: that to apply many

      all Forms admit of intercommunion one with the other. 2. Or no
      Forms admit of such intercommunion. 3. Or some Forms do admit of
      it, and others not. Between these three an option must be made.<a

    <p>
      If we take the first alternative &#8212; that there is no intercommunion
      of Forms &#8212; then the Forms <i>motion</i> and <i>rest</i> can have
      no intercommunion with the Forms, <i>essence</i> or <i>reality</i>.
      In other words, neither motion nor rest exist: and thus the theory
      both of those who say that all things are in perpetual movement,
      and of those who say that all things are in perpetual rest,
      becomes unfounded and impossible. Besides, these very men, who
      deny all intercommunion of Forms, are obliged to admit it
      implicitly and involuntarily in their common forms of speech. They

    <p>
      The second alternative &#8212; that all Forms may enter into communion
      with each other &#8212; is also easily refuted. If this were true,
      motion and rest might be put together: motion would be at rest,
      and rest would be in motion &#8212; which is absurd. These and other
      forms are contrary to each other. They reciprocally exclude and
      repudiate all intercommunion.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_57"

        others not. This is the only admissible doctrine. Analogy of
        letters and syllables.</span></p>
    <p>
      Remains only the third alternative &#8212; that some forms admit of
      intercommunion &#8212; others not. This is the real truth (says the
      Eleate). So it stands in regard to letters and words in language:
      some letters come together in words frequently and conveniently &#8212;
      others rarely and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page208"
          id="v3page208"></a>208</span>awkwardly &#8212; others never do nor
      ever can come together. The same with the combination of sounds to
      obtain music. It requires skill and art to determine which of
      these combinations are admissible.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_33"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_33"></a>Art and skill are required to
        distinguish what Forms admit of intercommunion, and what Forms
        do not. This is the special intelligence of the Philosopher, who
        lives in the bright region of Ens: the Sophist lives in the
        darkness of Non-Ens.</span></p>
    <p>
      So also, in regard to the intercommunion of Forms, skill and art
      are required to decide which of them will come together, and which
      will not. In every special art and profession the case is similar:
      the ignorant man will fail in deciding this question &#8212; the man of
      special skill alone will succeed. &#8212; So in regard to the
      intercommunion of Forms or Genera universally with each other, the
      comprehensive science of the true philosopher is required to
      decide.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_58" href="#Footnotev3_29_58"><span
          class="sp">58</span></a> To note and study these Forms, is the
      purpose of the philosopher in his dialectics or ratiocinative
      debate. He can trace the one Form or Idea, stretching through a
      great many separate particulars; he can distinguish it from all
      different Forms: he knows which Forms are not merely distinct from
      each other, but incapable of alliance and reciprocally repulsive &#8212;
      which of them are capable of complete conjunction, the one
      circumscribing and comprehending the other &#8212; and which of them
      admit conjunction partial and occasional with each other.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_59" href="#Footnotev3_29_59"><span
          class="sp">59</span></a> The philosopher thus keeps close to
      the Form of eternal and unchangeable Ens or Reality &#8212; a region of
      such bright light that the eyes of the vulgar cannot clearly see
      him: while the Sophist on the other hand is also difficult to be
      seen, but for an opposite reason &#8212; from the darkness of that
      region of Non-Ens or Non-Reality wherein he carries on his
      routine-work.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_60" href="#Footnotev3_29_60"><span

        Ens &#8212; Same &#8212; Different.</span></p>
    <p>
      We have still to determine, however (continues Plato), what this
      Non-Ens or Non-Reality is. For this purpose we will take a survey,
      not of all Forms or Genera, but of some few the most important. We
      will begin with the two before noticed &#8212; Motion and Rest <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page209" id="v3page209"></a>209</span>(
      = Change and Permanence), which are confessedly irreconcileable
      and reciprocally exclusive. Ens however enters into partnership
      with both: for both of them <i>are</i>, or exist.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_61" href="#Footnotev3_29_61"><span
          class="sp">61</span></a> This makes up three Forms or Genera &#8212;
      Motion, Rest, Ens: each of the three being the same with itself,
      and different from the other two. Here we have pronounced two new
      words &#8212; Same &#8212; Different.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_62"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> Do these
      words designate two other Forms, over and above the three
      before-named, yet necessarily always intermingling in partnership
      with those three, so as to make five Forms in all? Or are these
      two &#8212; Same and Different &#8212; essential appendages of the three
      before-named? This last question must be answered in the negative.
      Same and Different are not essential appendages, or attached as
      parts, to Motion, Rest, Ens. Same and Different may be predicated
      both of Motion and of Rest: and whatever can be predicated alike
      of two contraries, cannot be an essential portion or appendage of
      either. Neither Motion nor Rest therefore <i>are</i> essentially
      either Same or Different: though both of them partake of Same or
      Different &#8212; <i>i.e.</i>, come into accidental co-partnership with
      one as well as the other.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_63"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> Neither
      can we say that Ens is identical with either Idem or Diversum. Not
      with Idem &#8212; for we speak of both Motion and Rest as Entia or
      Existences: but we cannot speak of them as the same. Not with
      Diversum &#8212; for <i>different</i> is a name relative to something
      else from which it is different, but Ens is not thus relative.
      Motion and Rest <i>are</i> or exist, each in itself: but each is
      <i>different</i>, relatively to the other, and to other things
      generally. Accordingly we have here five Forms or Genera &#8212; Ens,
      Motion, Rest, Idem, Diversum: each distinct from and independent
      of all the rest.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_64"

      a certain way, and also not Diversum: different and not different.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_67" href="#Footnotev3_29_67"><span
          class="sp">67</span></a> As it is different from Rest, from
      Idem, from Diversum &#8212; so also it is different from Ens, the
      remaining one of the five forms or genera. In other words Motion
      is not Ens, &#8212; or is Non-Ens. It is both Ens, and Non-Ens: Ens, so
      far as it partakes of Entity or Reality &#8212; Non-Ens, so far as it
      partakes of Difference, and is thus different from Ens as well as
      from the other Forms.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_68"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> The same
      may be said of the other Forms, &#8212; Rest, Idem, Diversum: each of
      them is Ens, because it partakes of entity or reality: each of
      them is also Non-Ens, or different from Ens, because it partakes
      of Difference. Moreover, Ens itself is different from the other
      four, and so far as these others go, it is Non-Ens.<a

    <p>
      Now note the consequence (continues the Eleate). When we speak of
      Non-Ens, we do not mean any thing contrary to Ens, but only
      something different from Ens. When we call any thing <i>not great</i>,
      we do not affirm it <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page211"
          id="v3page211"></a>211</span>to be the contrary of great, or
      to be <i>little</i>: for it may perhaps be simply equal: we only
      mean that it is different from great.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_70"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> A
      negative proposition, generally, does not signify anything

        href="#Footnotev3_29_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> The Form
      of Different, though of one and the same general nature
      throughout, is distributed into many separate parts or
      specialties, according as it is attached to different things. Thus
      <i>not beautiful</i> is a special mode of the general Form or
      Genus Different, placed in antithesis with another Form or Genus,
      <i>the beautiful</i>. The antithesis is that of one Ens or Real
      thing against another Ens or Real thing: <i>not beautiful</i>, <i>not
        great</i>, <i>not just</i>, exist just as much and are quite as
      real, as <i>beautiful</i>, <i>great</i>, <i>just</i>. If the
      Different be a real Form or Genus, all its varieties must be real
      also. Accordingly Different from Ens is just as much a real Form
      as Ens itself:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_72" href="#Footnotev3_29_72"><span

        Parmenides, and to have shown both that Non-Ens is a real Form,
        and also what it is.</span></p>
    <p>
      Here then the Eleate professes to have found what Non-Ens is: that
      it is a real substantive Form, numerable among the other Forms,
      and having a separate constant nature of its own, like <i>not
        beautiful</i>, <i>not great</i>:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_73"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a> that it
      is real and existent, just as much as <i>Ens</i>, <i>beautiful</i>,
      <i>great</i>, &amp;c. Disregarding the prohibition of Parmenides,
      we have shown (says he) not only that Non-Ens exists, but also
      what it is. Many Forms or Genera enter into partnership or
      communion with each other; and Non-Ens is the partnership between
      Ens and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page212" id="v3page212"></a>212</span>Diversum.
      Diversum, in partnership with Ens, <i>is</i> (exists), in
      consequence of such partnership:&#8212; yet <i>it is not</i> that with
      which it is in partnership, but different therefrom &#8212; and being
      thus different from Ens, it is clearly and necessarily Non-Ens:
      while Ens also, by virtue of its partnership with Diversum, is
      different from all the other Forms, or <i>is not</i> any one of
      them, and to this extent therefore Ens is Non-Ens. We drop
      altogether the idea of contrariety, without enquiring whether it
      be reasonably justifiable or not: we attach ourselves entirely to
      the Form &#8212; <i>Different</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_74"

        The language of the Eleate here is altogether at variance with
        the spirit of Plato in his negative or Searching Dialogues. To
        say, as he does, &#8220;Either accept the explanation which I give, or
        propose a better of your own&#8221; &#8212; is a dilemma which the Sokrates
        of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, and other dialogues, would have
        declined altogether. The complaint here made by the Eleate,
        against disputants who did nothing but propound difficulties &#8212;
        is the same as that which the hearers of Sokrates made against <i>him</i>
        (see Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 20 A, where the remark is put
        into the mouth, not of an opponent, but of a respectful young
        listener); and many a reader of the Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s
        has indulged in the complaint.</p>

      The Eleate next proceeds to consider, whether these two Genera or

      Non-Ens on the other &#8212; are among those which may or do enter into
      partnership and conjunction with each other. For we have admitted
      that there are some Forms which cannot come into partnership; and
      the Sophist against whom we are reasoning, though we have driven
      him to concede that Non-Ens is a real Form, may still contend that
      it is one of those which cannot come into partnership with
      Proposition, Judgment, Opinion &#8212; and he may allege that we can
      neither embody in language, nor in mental judgment, that which <i>is

        of <i>Something</i>. False propositions, involve the Form of
        Non-Ens, in relation to the particular subject.</span></p>
    <p>
      Let us look attentively what Proposition, Judgment, Opinion, are.
      As we said about Forms and letters, so about words: it is not
      every combination of words which is possible, so as to make up a
      significant proposition. A string of nouns alone will not make
      one, nor a string of verbs alone. To compose the simplest
      proposition, you must put together at least one noun and one verb,
      in order to signify something respecting things existing, or
      events past, present, and future.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_80"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> Now
      every proposition must be a proposition about something, or
      belonging to a certain subject: every proposition must also be of
      a certain quality.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_81"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a> <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying.</i>
      Here are two propositions, both belonging to the same subject, but
      with opposite qualities: the former true, the latter false. The
      true proposition affirms respecting The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus real
      things as they are; the false proposition affirms respecting him
      things <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page214" id="v3page214"></a>214</span>different
      from real, or non-real, as being real. The attribute of <i>flying</i>
      is just as real in itself as the attribute of <i>sitting</i>: but
      as respects The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, or as predicated concerning
      him, it is different from the reality, or non-real.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_82" href="#Footnotev3_29_82"><span
          class="sp">82</span></a> But still The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is
      the subject of the proposition, though the predicate <i>flying</i>
      does not really belong to him: for there is no other subject than
      he, and without a subject the proposition would be no proposition
      at all. When therefore different things are affirmed as the same,
      or non-realities as realities, respecting you or any given
      subject, the proposition so affirming is false.<a

      As propositions may be true or false, so also opinion or judgment

      Parmenides, and against the plea of the Sophist founded on the
      Parmenidean doctrine.</p>

        imitating Truth, is theoretically possible, and that there may
        be a profession, like that of the Sophist, engaged in producing
        it.</span></p>
    <p>
      Here Plato closes his general philosophical discussion, and
      reverts to the process of logical division from which he had
      deviated. In descending the predicamental steps, to find the
      logical place of the Sophist, Plato had reached a point where he
      assumed Non-Ens, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page215"
          id="v3page215"></a>215</span> with false propositions and
      judgments affirming Non-Ens. To which the Sophist is conceived as
      replying, that Non-Ens was contradictory and impossible, and that
      no proposition could be false. On these points Plato has produced
      an elaborate argument intended to refute him, and to show that
      there was such a thing as falsehood imitating truth, or passing
      itself off as truth: accordingly, that there might be an art or
      profession engaged in producing such falsehood.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_29_44"></a>Logical distribution of Imitators &#8212;
        those who imitate what they know, or what they do not know &#8212; of
        these last, some sincerely believe themselves to know, others
        are conscious that they do not know, and designedly impose upon
        others.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now the imitative profession may be distributed into those who
      know what they imitate &#8212; and those who imitate without knowing.<a

      voice, knows what he imitates: those who imitate the figure of
      justice and virtue often pass themselves off as knowing it, yet do
      not really know it, having nothing better than fancy or opinion
      concerning it. Of these latter again &#8212; (<i>i.e.</i> the imitators
      with mere opinion, but no knowledge, respecting that which
      sincerely they imitate) &#8212; there are two classes: one, those who
      sincerely mistake their own mere opinions for knowledge, and are
      falsely persuaded that they really know: the other class, those
      who by their perpetual occupation in talking, lead us to suspect
      and apprehend that they are conscious of not knowing things, which
      nevertheless they discuss before others as if they did know.<a

          id="Sidenotev3_29_46"></a>Dialogue closed. Remarks upon it.
        Characteristics ascribed to a Sophist.</span></p>
    <p>
      We have here the conclusion of this abstruse and complicated
      dialogue, called Sophist&ecirc;s. It ends by setting forth, as the
      leading characteristics of the Sophist &#8212; that he deals in short
      question and answer so as to make the respondent contradict
      himself: That he talks with small circles of listeners, upon a
      large variety of subjects, on which he possesses no real
      knowledge: That he mystifies or imposes upon his auditors; not
      giving his own sincere convictions, but talking for the production
      of a special effect. He is &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; and &#949;&#7988;&#961;&#969;&#957;, to employ
      the two original Platonic words, neither of which is easy to
      translate.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_47"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_47"></a>These characteristics may have
        belonged to other persons, but they belonged in an especial
        manner to Sokrates himself.</span></p>
    <p>
      I dare say that there were some acute and subtle disputants in
      Athens to whom these characteristics belonged, though we do not
      know them by name. But we know one to whom they certainly
      belonged: and that was, Sokrates himself. They stand manifest and
      prominent both in the Platonic and in the Xenophontic dialogues.
      The attribute which Xenophon directly predicates about him, that
      &#8220;in conversation he dealt with his interlocutors just as he
      pleased,&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_88" href="#Footnotev3_29_88"><span
          class="sp">88</span></a> is amply exemplified by Plato in the
      Protagoras, Gorgias, Euthyphron, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmides, Lysias,
      Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II., Hippias I. and II., &amp;c. That he
      cross-examined and puzzled every one else without knowing the
      subjects on which he talked, better than they did &#8212; is his own
      declaration in the Apology. That the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page217" id="v3page217"></a>217</span>Athenians
      regarded him as a clever man mystifying them &#8212; talking without
      sincere persuasion, or in a manner so strange that you could not
      tell whether he was in jest or in earnest &#8212; overthrowing men&#8217;s
      established convictions by subtleties which led to no positive
      truth &#8212; is also attested both by what he himself says in the
      Apology, and by other passages of Plato and Xenophon.<a

        Xen. Memor. i. 2, 14, &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953; &#967;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;

      <p>
        Compare, to the same purpose, i. 4, 1, where we are told that
        Sokrates employed his colloquial Elenchus as a means of
        chastising (&#954;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;) those who thought that they knew
        every thing: and the conversation of Sokrates with the youthful
        Euthyd&ecirc;mus, especially what is said by Xenophon at the
        close of it (iv. 4, 39-40). </p>
      <p>
        The power of Sokrates to vanquish in dialogue the persons called
        Sophists, and to make them contradict themselves in answering &#8212;
        is clearly brought out, and doubtless intentionally brought out,
        in some of Plato&#8217;s most consummate dialogues. Alkibiades says,
        in the Platonic Protagoras (p. 336), &#8220;Sokrates confesses himself
        no match for Protagoras in long speaking. If Protagoras on his
        side confesses himself inferior to Sokrates in dialogue,
        Sokrates is satisfied.&#8221;</p>

        a very special manner, not merely in the Platonic dialogues, but
        also by Timon in the fragments of his Silli remaining &#8212; &#913;&#8016;&#964;&#8052;

        E. In another part of the Gorgias (p. 481 B), Kallikles says,
        &#8220;Tell me, Ch&aelig;rephon, does Sokrates mean seriously what he
        says, or is he bantering?&#8221; &#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7970; &#960;&#945;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;;
        Protagoras, Prodikus, Hippias, &amp;c., do not seem to have been
        &#949;&#7988;&#961;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#962; at all, as far as our scanty knowledge goes.</p>
      <p>
        The words &#949;&#7988;&#961;&#969;&#957;, &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945; seem to include more than

        meaning one who either speaks what he does not think, or evades
        speaking what he does think, in order to serve some special
        purpose.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_48"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_48"></a>The conditions enumerated in the
        dialogue (except the taking of a fee) fit Sokrates better than
        any other known person.</span></p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if we examine not merely the special features assigned
      to the Sophist in the conclusion of the dialogue, but also those
      indicated in the earlier part of it, we shall find that many of
      them fit Sokrates as well as they could have fitted any one else.
      If the Sophists hunted after rich young men,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_90" href="#Footnotev3_29_90"><span
          class="sp">90</span></a> Sokrates did the same; seeking
      opportunities for conversation with them by assiduous
      frequentation of the pal&aelig;str&aelig;, as well as in other
      ways. We see this amply attested by Plato and Xenophon:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_91" href="#Footnotev3_29_91"><span
          class="sp">91</span></a> we see farther that Sokrates
      announces <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page218"
          id="v3page218"></a>218</span>it as a propensity natural to
      him, and meritorious rather than otherwise. Again, the
      argumentative dialogue &#8212; disputation or eristic reduced to an art,
      and debating on the general theses of just and unjust, which Plato
      notes as characterising the Sophists<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_92"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> &#8212;
      belonged in still higher perfection to Sokrates. It not only
      formed the business of his life, but is extolled by Plato
      elsewhere,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_93" href="#Footnotev3_29_93"><span
          class="sp">93</span></a> as the true walk of virtuous
      philosophy. But there was undoubtedly this difference between
      Sokrates and the Sophists, that he conversed and argued
      gratuitously, delighting in the process itself: while they both
      asked and received money for it. Upon this point, brought forward
      by Plato both directly and with his remarkable fertility in
      multiplying indirect allusions, the peculiarity of the Sophist is
      made mainly to turn. To ask or receive a fee for communicating
      knowledge, virtue, aptitude in debate, was in the view of Sokrates
      and Plato a grave enormity: a kind of simoniacal practice.<a

        Hippokrates, far from being run after by the Sophist Protagoras,
        is described as an enthusiastic admirer of that Sophist from
        reputation alone, and as eagerly soliciting Sokrates to present
        him to Protagoras (Protag. pp. 310-311).</p>

        It is to be remembered, however, that Plato, though doubtless
        exacting no fee, received presents from rich admirers like Dion
        and Dionysius: and there were various teachers who found
        presents more lucrative than fees. &#8220;M. Antonius Guipho, fuisse

        thoroughbred and noble Sophistical Art&#8221; belongs to Sokrates and

        Prodikus were not Sophists in this sense.</span></p>
    <p>
      We have seen also that Plato assigns to what he terms &#8220;the
      thoroughbred and noble Sophistic Art&#8221; (&#7969; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#945; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;),
      the employment of the Elenchus, for the purpose of destroying, in
      the minds of others, that false persuasion of existing knowledge
      which was the radical impediment to their imbibing acquisitions of
      real knowledge from the teacher.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_95"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a> Here
      Plato draws <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page219"
          id="v3page219"></a>219</span>a portrait not only strikingly
      resembling Sokrates, but resembling no one else. As far as we can
      make out, Sokrates stood alone in this original conception of the
      purpose of the Elenchus, and in his no less original manner of
      working it out. To prove to others that they knew nothing, is what
      he himself represents to be his mission from the Delphian oracle.
      Sokrates is a Sophist of the most genuine and noble stamp: others
      are Sophists, but of a more degenerate variety. Plato admits the
      analogy with reluctance, and seeks to attenuate it.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_96" href="#Footnotev3_29_96"><span
          class="sp">96</span></a> We may remark, however, that
      according to the characteristic of the true Sophist here given by
      Plato, Protagoras and Prodikus were less of Sophists than
      Sokrates. For though we know little of the two former, yet there
      is good reason to believe, That the method which they generally
      employed was, that of continuous and eloquent discourse, lecture,
      exhortation: that disputation by short question and answer was
      less usual with them, and was not their strong point: and that the
      Elenchus, in the Sokratic meaning, can hardly be said to have been
      used by them at all. Now Plato, in this dialogue, tells us that
      the true and genuine Sophist renounces the method of exhortation
      as unprofitable; or at least employs it only subject to the
      condition of having previously administered the Elenchus with
      success, as his own patent medicine.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_97"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> Upon
      this definition, Sokrates is more truly a Sophist than either
      Protagoras or Prodikus: neither of whom, so far as we know, made
      it their business to drive the respondent to contradictions.</p>

        at that time by all Philosophers &#8212; Plato, Aristotle, &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>
      Again, Plato tells us that the Sophist is a person who disputes
      about all matters, and pretends to know all matters: respecting
      the invisible Gods, respecting the visible Gods, Sun, Moon, Stars,
      Earth, &amp;c., respecting transcendental philosophy, generation
      and essence &#8212; and respecting all civil, social, and political
      questions &#8212; and respecting special arts. On all these
      miscellaneous topics, according to Plato, the Sophists pretended
      to be themselves instructed, and to qualify their disciples for
      arguing on all of them.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page220" id="v3page220"></a>220</span>Now
      it is possible that the Sophists of that day may have pretended to
      this species of universal knowledge; but most certainly Plato and
      Aristotle did the same. The dialogues of Plato embrace all that
      wide range of topics which he tells us that the Sophists argued
      about, and pretended to teach. In an age when the amount of
      positive knowledge was so slender, it was natural for a clever
      talker or writer to fancy that he knew every thing. In reference
      to every subject then discussed, an ingenious mind could readily
      supply deductions from both hypotheses &#8212; generalities
      ratiocinative or imaginative &#8212; strung together into an apparent
      order sufficient for the exigencies of hearers. There was no large
      range of books to be studied; no stock of facts or experience to
      be mastered. Every philosopher wove his own tissue of theory for
      himself, without any restraint upon his intellectual impulse, in
      regard to all the problems then afloat. What the theories of the
      Sophists were, we do not know: but Plato, author of the
      Tim&aelig;us, Republic, Leges, Kratylus, Menon &#8212; who affirmed the
      pre-existence as well as post-existence of the mind, and the
      eternal self-existence of Ideas &#8212; has no fair ground for
      reproaching them with blamable rashness in the extent and
      diversity of topics which they presumed to discuss. They obtained
      indeed (he says justly) no truth or knowledge, but merely a
      fanciful semblance of knowledge &#8212; an equivocal show or imitation
      of reality.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_98" href="#Footnotev3_29_98"><span
          class="sp">98</span></a> But Plato himself obtains nothing
      more in the Tim&aelig;us: and we shall find Aristotle pronouncing
      the like condemnation on the Platonic self-existent Ideas. If the
      Sophists professed to be encyclopedists, this was an error natural
      to the age; and was the character of Grecian philosophy generally,
      even in its most illustrious manifestations.</p>

        also that the Sophist is one who maintains false propositions to
        be impossible.</span></p>
    <p>
      Having traced the Sophist down to the character of a man of
      delusion and imposture, passing off appearance as if it were
      reality, and falsehood as if it were truth &#8212; Plato <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page221" id="v3page221"></a>221</span>(as
      we have seen) suddenly turns round upon himself, and asks how such
      a character is possible. He represents the Sophist as maintaining
      that no man could speak falsely<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_99"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> &#8212; that a
      false proposition was self-contradictory, inasmuch as Non-Ens was
      inconceivable and unutterable. I do not see how the argument which
      Plato here ascribes to the Sophist, can be reconciled with the
      character which he had before given of the Sophist &#8212; as a man who
      passed his life in disputation and controversy; which involves the
      perpetual arraigning of other men&#8217;s opinions as false. A professed
      disputant may perhaps be accused of admitting nothing to be true:
      but he cannot well be charged with maintaining that nothing is
      false.</p>

        No predications except identical.</span></p>
    <p>
      To pass over this inconsistency, however &#8212; the reasoning of Plato
      himself on the subject of Non-Ens is an interesting relic of
      ancient speculation. He has made for himself an opportunity of
      canvassing, not only the doctrine of Parmenides, who emphatically
      denied Non-Ens &#8212; but also the opposite doctrine of other schools.
      He farther comments upon a different opinion, advanced by other
      philosophers &#8212; That no proposition can be admitted, in which the
      predicate is different from the subject: That no proposition is
      true or valid, except an identical proposition. You cannot say,
      Man is good: you can only say, Man is Man, or Good is good. You
      cannot say &#8212; Sokrates is good, brave, old, stout, flat-nosed,
      &amp;c., because you thereby multiply the one Sokrates into many.
      One thing cannot be many, nor many things one.<a

          id="Sidenotev3_29_53"></a>Misconception of the function of the
        copula in predication.</span></p>
    <p>
      This last opinion is said to have been held by Antisthenes, one of
      the disciples of Sokrates. We do not know how he explained or
      defended it, nor what reserves he may have admitted to qualify it.
      Plato takes no pains to inform us on this point. He treats the
      opinion with derision, as an absurdity. We may conceive it as one
      of the many errors arising from a misconception of the purpose and
      function of the copula in predication. Antisthenes <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page222" id="v3page222"></a>222</span>probably
      considered that the copula implied identity between the predicate
      and the subject. Now the explanation or definition of <i>man</i>
      is different from the explanation or definition of <i>good</i>:
      accordingly, if you say, Man is good, you predicate identity
      between two different things: as if you were to say Two is Three,
      or Three is Four. And if the predicates were multiplied, the
      contradiction became aggravated, because then you predicated
      identity not merely between one thing and another different thing,
      but between one thing and many different things. The opinion of
      Antisthenes depends upon two assumptions &#8212; That each separate
      word, whether used as subject or as predicate, denotes a Something
      separate and existent by itself: That the copula implies identity.
      Now the first of these two assumptions is not unfrequently
      admitted, even in the reasonings of Plato, Aristotle, and many
      others: while the latter is not more remarkable than various other
      erroneous conceptions which have been entertained, as to the
      function of the copula.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_54"

        at that time. No analysis or classification of propositions
        before the works of Aristotle.</span></p>
    <p>
      What is most important to observe is &#8212; That at the time which we
      are here discussing, there existed no such sciences either grammar
      or formal logic. There was a copious and flexible language &#8212; a
      large body of literature, chiefly poetical &#8212; and great facility as
      well as felicity in the use of speech for the purposes of
      communication and persuasion. But no attempt had yet been made to
      analyse or theorise on speech: to distinguish between the
      different functions of words, and to throw them into suitable
      classes: to generalise the conditions of good or bad use of speech
      for proving a conclusion: or to draw up rules for grammar, syntax,
      and logic. Both Protagoras and Prodikus appear to have contributed
      something towards this object, and Plato gives various scattered
      remarks going still farther. But there was no regular body either
      of grammar or of formal logic: no established rules or principles
      to appeal to, no recognised teaching, on either topic. It was
      Aristotle who rendered the important service of filling up this
      gap. I shall touch hereafter upon the manner in which he
      proceeded: but the necessity of laying down a good theory of
      predication, and precepts respecting the employment of
      propositions in reasoning, is best shown by such misconceptions as
      this <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page223" id="v3page223"></a>223</span>of
      Antisthenes; which naturally arise among argumentative men yet

      recognise two co-ordinate and elementary principles (such as Hot
      and Cold) maintain that both are really existent, and call them
      both, Entia. Here (argues Plato) they contradict themselves: they

      Then again, Parmenides &#8212; and those who affirm that Ens Totum was
      essentially Unum, denying all plurality &#8212; had difficulties on
      their side to surmount. Ens could not be identical with Unum, nor
      was the name <i>Ens</i>, identical with the thing named Ens.
      Moreover, though Ens Unum was <i>Totum</i>, yet Totum was not
      identical with Ens or with Unum. <i>Totum</i> necessarily implied
      <i>partes</i>: but the <i>Unum per se</i> was indivisible or
      implied absence of parts. Though it was true therefore that Ens
      was both Unum and Totum, these two were both of them essentially
      different from Ens, and belonged to it only by way of adjunct
      accident. Parmenides was therefore wrong in saying that Unum alone
      existed.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_29_56"></a>Plato&#8217;s refutation throws light upon
        the doctrine of Antisthenes.</span></p>
    <p>
      The reasoning here given from Plato throws some light upon the
      doctrine just now cited from Antisthenes. You cannot say (argues
      Plato against the advocates of duality) that <i>two</i> elements
      (Hot and Cold) are both of them Entia or Existent, because by so
      doing you call them <i>one</i>. You cannot say (argues
      Antisthenes) that Sokrates is good, brave, old, &amp;c., because
      by such speech you call one thing three. Again, in controverting
      the doctrine of Parmenides,<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page224" id="v3page224"></a>224</span> Plato urges,
      That Ens cannot <i>be</i> Unum, because it is Totum (Unum having
      no parts, while Totum has parts): but it may carry with it the
      accident Unum, or may have Unum applied to it as a predicate by
      accident. Here again, we have difficulties similar to those which
      perplexed Antisthenes. For the same reason that Plato will not
      admit, That Ens <i>is</i> Unum &#8212; Antisthenes will not admit, That
      Man <i>is</i> good. It appeared to him to imply essential
      identity between the predicate and the subject.</p>
    <p>
      All these difficulties and others to which we shall come
      presently, noway peculiar to Antisthenes &#8212; attest the incomplete
      formal logic of the time: the want of a good theory respecting
      predication and the function of the copula.</p>

    <p>
      Pursuing the purpose of establishing his conclusion (<i>viz.</i>
      That Ens involved as many perplexities as Non-Ens), Plato comes to
      the two opposite sects:&#8212; 1. Those (the Materialists) who
      recognised bodies and nothing else, as the real Entia or
      Existences. 2. Those (the Friends of Forms, the Idealists) who
      maintained that incorporeal and intelligible Forms or Species were
      the only real existences; and that bodies had no existence, but
      were in perpetual generation and destruction.<a

      Respecting the first, Plato says that they must after all be
      ashamed not to admit, that justice, intelligence, &amp;c., are
      something real, which may be present or absent in different
      individual men, and therefore must exist apart from all
      individuals. Yet justice and intelligence are not bodies.
      Existence therefore is something common to body and not-body. The
      characteristic mark of existence is, power or potentiality.
      Whatever has power to act upon any thing else, or to be acted on
      by any thing else, is a real Ens or existent something.<a

      Unfortunately we never know any thing about the opponents of
      Plato, nor how they would have answered his objection &#8212; except so
      much as he chooses to tell us. But it appears to me that the
      opponents whom he is here <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page225" id="v3page225"></a>225</span>confuting would
      have accepted his definition, and employed it for the support of
      their own opinion. &#8220;We recognise (they would say) just men, or
      hard bodies, as existent, because they conform to your definition:
      they have power to act and be acted upon. But justice, apart from
      just men &#8212; hardness, apart from hard bodies &#8212; has no such power:
      they neither act upon any thing, nor are acted on by any thing:
      therefore we do not recognise them as existent.&#8221; According to
      their view, objects of perception acted on the mind, and therefore
      were to be recognised as existent: objects of mere conception did
      not act on the mind, and therefore had not the same claim to be
      ranked as existent: or at any rate they acted on the mind in a
      different way, which constitutes the difference between the real
      and unreal. Of this difference Plato&#8217;s definition takes no

        Idealists or Friends of Forms. Their point of view against him.</span></p>
    <p>
      Plato now presents this same definition to the opposite class of
      philosophers: to the Idealists, or partisans of the incorporeal &#8212;
      or of self-existent and separate Forms. These thinkers drew a
      marked distinction between the Existent and the Generated &#8212;
      between Ens and Fiens &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#8002;&#957; and &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;. Ens or the
      Existent was eternal and unchangeable: Fiens or the Generated was
      always in change or transit, coming or going. We hold communion
      (they said) with the generated or transitory, through our bodies
      and sensible perceptions: we hold communion with unchangeable Ens
      through our mind and by intellection. They did not admit the
      definition of existence just given by Plato. They contended that
      that definition applied only to Fiens or to the sensible world &#8212;
      not to Ens or the intelligible world.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_105"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a> Fiens
      had power to act and be acted upon, and existed only under the
      condition of being so: that is, its existence was only temporary,
      conditional, relative: it had no permanent or absolute existence
      at all. Ens was the real existent, absolute and independent &#8212;
      neither acting upon any thing nor being acted upon. They
      considered that Plato&#8217;s definition was not a definition of
      Existence, or the Absolute: but rather of Non-Existence, or the
      Relative.</p>

    <p>
      The definition of <i>existence</i>, here given by Plato, and the
      way in which he employs it against the two different sects of
      philosophers &#8212; Materialists and Idealists &#8212; deserves some remark.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_61"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_61"></a>Plato&#8217;s reasoning &#8212; compared with
        the points of view of both.</span></p>
    <p>
      According to the Idealists or Immaterialists, Plato&#8217;s definition
      of existence would be supposed to establish the case of their
      opponents the Materialists, who recognised nothing as existing
      except the sensible world: for Plato&#8217;s definition (as the
      Idealists thought) fitted the sensible world, but fitted nothing
      else. Now these Idealists did not recognise the sensible world as
      existent at all. They considered it merely as Fiens, ever
      appearing and vanishing. The only Existent, in their view, was the
      intelligible world &#8212; Form or Forms, absolute, eternal,
      unchangeable, but neither visible nor perceivable by any of the
      other senses. This is the opinion against which Plato <i>here</i>
      reasons, though in various other dialogues he gives it as his own
      opinion, or at least, as the opinion of his representative
      spokesman.</p>
    <p>
      In this portion of the present dialogue (Sophist&ecirc;s) the
      point which he makes is, to show to the Idealists, or Absolutists,
      that their Forms are not really absolute, or independent of the
      mind: that the existence of these forms is relative, just as much
      as that of the sensible world. The sensible world exists
      relatively to our senses, really or potentially exercised: the
      intelligible world <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page227"
          id="v3page227"></a>227</span>exists relatively to our
      intelligence, really or potentially exercised. In both cases
      alike, we hold communion with the two worlds: the communion cannot
      be left out of sight, either in the one case or in the other. The
      communion is the entire and fundamental fact, of which the Subject
      conceiving and the Object conceived, form the two opposite but
      inseparable faces &#8212; the concave and convex, to employ a favourite
      illustration of Aristotle. Subject conceiving, in communion with
      Object conceived, are one and the same indivisible fact, looked at
      on different sides. This is, in substance, what Plato urges
      against those philosophers who asserted the absolute and
      independent existence of intelligible Forms. Such forms (he says)
      exist only in communion with, or relatively to, an intelligent
      mind: they are not absolute, not independent: they are Objects of
      intelligence to an intelligent Subject, but they are nothing
      without the Subject, just as the Subject is nothing without them
      or some other Object. Object of intelligence implies an
      intelligent Subject: Object of sense implies a sentient Subject.
      Thus Objects of intelligence, and Objects of sense, exist alike
      relatively to a Subject &#8212; not absolutely or independently.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_62"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_62"></a>The argument of Plato goes to an
        entire denial of the Absolute, and a full establishment of the
        Relative.</span></p>
    <p>
      This argument, then, of Plato against the Idealists is an argument
      against the Absolute &#8212; showing that there can be no Object of
      intelligence or conception without its obverse side, the
      intelligent or concipient Subject. The Idealists held, that by
      soaring above the sensible world into the intelligible world, they
      got out of the region of the Relative into that of the Absolute.
      But Plato reminds them that this is not the fact. Their
      intelligible world is relative, not less than the sensible; that
      is, it exists only in communion with a mind or Subject, but with a
      Cogitant or intelligent Subject, not a percipient Subject.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_63"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_63"></a>Coincidence of his argument with the
        doctrine of Protagoras in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus.</span></p>
    <p>
      The argument here urged by Plato coincides in its drift and result
      with the dictum of Protagoras &#8212; Man is the measure of all things.
      In my remarks on the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_107" href="#Footnotev3_29_107"><span
          class="sp">107</span></a> I endeavoured to make it appear that
      the Protagorean dictum was really a negation of the Absolute, of
      the Thing in itself, of the Object without a Subject:&#8212; <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page228" id="v3page228"></a>228</span>and
      an affirmation of the Relative, of the Thing in communion with a
      percipient or concipient mind, of Object implicated with Subject &#8212;
      as two aspects or sides of one and the same conception or
      cognition. Though Plato in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus argued at
      length against Protagoras, yet his reasoning here in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s establishes by implication the conclusion of
      Protagoras. Here Plato impugns the doctrine of those who (like
      Sokrates in his own The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus) held that the sensible
      world alone was relative, but that the intelligible world or Forms
      were absolute. He shows that the latter were no less relative to a
      mind than the former; and that mind, either percipient or
      cogitant, could never be eliminated from &#8220;communion&#8221; with them.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_64"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_64"></a>The Idealists maintained that Ideas
        or Forms were entirely unchangeable and eternal. Plato here
        denies this, and maintains that ideas were partly changeable,
        partly unchangeable.</span></p>
    <p>
      These same Idealist philosophers also maintained &#8212; That Forms, or
      the intelligible world, were eternally the same and unchangeable.
      Plato here affirms that this ideas or opinion is not true: he
      contends that the intelligible world includes both change and
      unchangeableness, motion and rest, difference and sameness, life,
      mind, intelligence, &amp;c. He argues that the intelligible world,
      whether assumed as consisting of one Form or of many Forms, could
      not be regarded either as wholly changeable or wholly
      unchangeable: it must comprise both constituents alike. If all
      were changeable, or if all were unchangeable, there could be no
      Object of knowledge; and, by consequence, no knowledge.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_108" href="#Footnotev3_29_108"><span
          class="sp">108</span></a> But the fact that there <i>is</i>
      knowledge (cognition, conception), is the fundamental fact from
      which we must reason; and any conclusion which contradicts this
      must be untrue. Therefore the intelligible world is not all
      homogeneous, but contains different and even opposite Forms &#8212;
      change and unchangeableness &#8212; motion and rest &#8212; different and
      same.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_109" href="#Footnotev3_29_109"><span

        Materialists.</span></p>
    <p>
      Let us now look at Plato&#8217;s argument, and his definition of
      existence, as they bear upon the doctrine of the opposing
      Materialist philosophers, whom he states to have held that bodies
      alone existed, and that the Incorporeal did not exist:&#8212; in other
      words that all real existence was concrete and particular: that
      the abstract <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page229"
          id="v3page229"></a>229</span>(universals, forms, attributes)
      had no real existence, certainly no separate existence. As I
      before remarked, it is not quite clear what or how much these
      philosophers denied. But as far as we can gather from Plato&#8217;s
      language, what they denied was, the existence of attributes <i>apart
        from</i> a substance. They did not deny the existence of just
      and wise men, but the existence of justice and wisdom, apart from
      men real or supposable.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_66"

        Abstract, not then made conspicuous. Large meaning here given by
        Plato to Ens &#8212; comprehending not only objects of Perception, but
        objects of Conception besides.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the time of Plato, distinction between the two classes of
      words, Concrete and Abstract, had not become so clearly matter of
      reflection as to be noted by two appropriate terms: in fact,
      logical terminology was yet in its first rudiments. It is
      therefore the less matter of wonder that Plato should not here
      advert to the relation between the two, or to the different sense
      in which existence might properly be predicable of both. He agrees
      with the materialists or friends of the Concrete, in affirming
      that sensible objects, Man, Horse, Tree, exist (which the
      Idealists or friends of the Abstract denied): but he differs from
      them by saying that other Objects, super-sensible and merely
      intelligible, exist also &#8212; namely, Justice, Virtue, Whiteness,
      Hardness, and other Forms or Attributes. He admits that these
      last-mentioned objects do not make themselves manifest to the
      senses; but they do make themselves manifest to the intelligence
      or the conception: and that is sufficient, in his opinion, to
      authenticate them as existent. The word <i>existent</i>,
      according to his definition (as given in this dialogue), includes
      not only all that is or may be perceived, but also all that is or
      may be known by the mind; <i>i.e.</i>, understood, conceived,
      imagined, talked or reasoned about. Existent, or Ens, is thus made
      purely relative: having its root in a Subject, but ramifying by
      its branches in every direction. It bears the widest possible
      sense, co-extensive with <i>Object</i> universally, either of
      perception or conception. It includes all fictions, as well as all
      (commonly called) realities. The conceivable and the existent
      become equivalent.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_67"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_67"></a>Narrower meaning given by
        Materialists to Ens &#8212; they included only Objects of Perception.
        Their reasoning as opposed to Plato.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now the friends of the Concrete, against whom Plato reasons, used
      the word <i>existent</i> in a narrower sense, as comprising only
      the concretes of the sensible world. They probably admitted the
      existence of the abstract, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page230" id="v3page230"></a>230</span>along with and
      particularised in the concrete: but they certainly denied the <i>separate</i>
      existence of the Abstract &#8212; <i>i.e.</i>, of Forms, Attributes, or
      classes, apart from particulars. They would not deny that many
      things were conceivable, more or less dissimilar from the
      realities of the sensible world: but they did not admit that all
      those conceivable things ought to be termed existent or realities,
      and put upon the same footing as the sensible world. They used the
      word <i>existent</i> to distinguish between Men, Horses, Trees,
      on the one hand &#8212; and Cyclopes, Centaurs, &#932;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#953;, &amp;c., on
      the other. A Centaur is just as intelligible and conceivable as
      either a man or a horse; and according to this definition of
      Plato, would be as much entitled to be called really existent. The
      attributes of <i>man</i> and <i>horse</i> are real, because the
      objects themselves are real and perceivable: the class <i>man</i>
      and the class <i>horse</i> is real, for the same reason: but the
      attributes of a Centaur, and the class Centaurs, are not real,
      because no individuals possessing the attributes, or belonging to
      the class, have ever been perceived, or authenticated by
      induction. Plato&#8217;s Materialist opponents would here have urged,
      that if he used the word <i>existent</i> or Ens in so wide a
      sense, comprehending all that is conceivable or nameable, fiction
      as well as reality &#8212; they would require some other words to
      distinguish fiction from reality &#8212; Centaur from Man: which is what
      most men mean when they speak of one thing as non-existent,
      another thing as existent. At any rate, here is an equivocal sense
      of the word Ens &#8212; a wider and a narrower sense &#8212; which, we shall
      find frequently perplexing us in the ancient metaphysics; and
      which, when sifted, will often prove, that what appears to be a
      difference of doctrine, is in reality little more than a
      difference of phraseology.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_110"

        Plato here aspires to deliver one definition of Ens, applying to
        all cases. The contrast between him and Aristotle is shown in
        the more cautious procedure of the latter, who entirely
        renounces the possibility of giving any one definition fitting
        all cases. Aristotle declares Ens to be an equivocal word
        (&#8001;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#957;), and discriminates several different significations
        which it bears: all these significations having nevertheless an
        analogical affinity, more or less remote, with each other. See
        Aristot. Metaphys. &#916;. 1017, a. 7, seq.; vi. 1028, a. 10. </p>

        This subject is well treated by Brentano, in his Dissertation
        Ueber die Bedeutung des Seienden im Aristoteles. See pp. 49-50
        seq., of that work. </p>
      <p>
        Aristotle observes truly, that these most general terms are the
        most convenient hiding-places for equivocal meaning (Anal. Post.
        ii. 97, b. 29). </p>
      <p>
        The analogical varieties of Ens or Essence are graduated,
        according to Aristotle: Complete, Proper, typical, &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, stands
        at the head: there are then other varieties more or less
        approaching to this proper type: some of them which &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#7970;
        &#959;&#8016;&#952;&#8050;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;. (Metaphys. vi. 1029, b. 9.)

        Plato &#8212; the Materialists, the Idealists.</span></p>
    <p>
      This enquiry respecting Ens is left by Plato professedly
      unsettled; according to his very frequent practice. He pretends
      only to have brought it to this point: that Ens or the Existent is
      shown to present as many difficulties and perplexities as Non-Ens
      or the non-existent.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_111"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a> I do
      not think that he has shown thus much; for, according to his
      definition, Non-Ens is an impossibility: the term is absolutely
      unmeaning: it is equivalent to the Unknowable or Inconceivable &#8212;
      as Parmenides affirmed it to be. But he has undoubtedly shown that
      Ens is in itself perplexing: which, instead of lightening the
      difficulties about Non-Ens, aggravates them: for all the
      difficulties about Ens must be solved, before you can pretend to
      understand Non-Ens. Plato has shown that Ens is used in three
      different meanings:&#8212; </p>
    <p>1. According to the Materialists, it means only the concrete and
      particular, including all the attributes thereof, essential and
      accidental.</p>
    <p>2. According to the Idealists or friends of Forms, it means only
      Universals, Forms, and Attributes.</p>
    <p>3. According to Plato&#8217;s own definition here given, it means both
      the one and the other: whatever the mind can either perceive or
      conceive: whatever can act upon the mind in any way, or for any
      time however short. It is therefore wholly relative to the mind:
      yet not exclusively to the <i>perceiving</i> mind (as the
      Materialists said), nor exclusively to the <i>conceiving</i> mind
      (as the friends of Forms said): but to both alike.</p>

        examined.</span></p>
    <p>
      Here is much confusion, partly real but principally verbal, about
      Ens. Plato proceeds to affirm, that the difficulty about Non-Ens
      is no greater, and that it admits of being elucidated. The higher
      Genera or Forms (he says) are such that some of them will combine
      or enter into communion with each other, wholly or partially,
      others will not, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page232"
          id="v3page232"></a>232</span>but are reciprocally exclusive.
      Motion and Rest will not enter into communion, but mutually
      exclude each other: neither of them can be predicated of the
      other. But each or both of them will enter into communion with
      Existence, which latter may be predicated of both. Here are three
      Genera or Forms: motion, rest, and existence. Each of them is the
      <i>same</i> with itself, and <i>different</i> from the other two.
      Thus we have two new distinct Forms or Genera &#8212; <i>Same</i> and <i>Different</i>
      &#8212; which enter into communion with the preceding three, but are in
      themselves distinct from them.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_112"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a>
      Accordingly you may say, motion <i>partakes</i> of (or enters
      into communion with) Diversum, because motion differs from rest:
      also you may say, motion <i>partakes</i> of Idem, as being
      identical with itself: but you cannot say, motion <i>is</i>
      different, motion <i>is</i> the same; because the subject and the
      predicate are essentially distinct and not identical.<a

        Plato here says, It is true that &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span>
        &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, but it is not true that &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;. Again, p.

        &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;. He understands, therefore, that &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, when used as
        copula, implies identity between the predicate and the subject.</p>
      <p>
        This is the same point of view from which Antisthenes looked,
        when he denied the propriety of saying &#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#972;&#962; <span
          class="gesp">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#962; &#8212; &#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#972;&#962; <span
          class="gesp">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;</span> &#954;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;: and when he admitted only
        identical propositions, such as &#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#972;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span>

        assumed that &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, when intervening between the subject and the
        predicate, implies identity between them; and the same
        assumption is made by Plato in the passage now before us.
        Whether Antisthenes would have allowed the proposition &#8212;
        &#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; <span class="gesp">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span> &#954;&#945;&#954;&#943;&#945;&#962;, or other
        propositions in which &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953; does not appear as copula, we do not
        know enough of his opinions to say.</p>
      <p>
        Compare Aristotel. Physic. i. 2, 185, b. 27, with the Scholia of

      Some things are always named or spoken of <i>per se</i>, others
      with reference to something else. Thus, Diversum is always
      different from something else: it is relative, implying a
      correlate.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_114" href="#Footnotev3_29_114"><span
          class="sp">114</span></a> In <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page233" id="v3page233"></a>233</span>this, as well as
      in other points, Diversum (or Different) is a distinct Form,
      Genus, or Idea, which runs through all other things whatever. Each
      thing is different from every other thing: but it differs from
      them, not through any thing in its own nature, but because it
      partakes of the Form or Idea of Diversum or the Different.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_115" href="#Footnotev3_29_115"><span
          class="sp">115</span></a> So, in like manner, the Form or Idea
      of Idem (or Same) runs through all other things: since each thing
      is both different from all others, and is also the same with
      itself.</p>

      <p>
        Here we have, for the first time so far as I know (certainly
        anterior to Aristotle), names <i>relative</i> and <i>non-relative</i>,
        distinguished as classes, and contrasted with each other. It is
        to be observed that Plato here uses &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; and &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; as
        equivalent; which is not very consistent with the sense which he

      Now motion is altogether different from rest Motion therefore <i>is
        not</i> rest. Yet still motion <i>is</i>, because it partakes
      of existence or Ens. Accordingly, motion both <i>is</i> and <i>is
        not</i>.</p>
    <p>
      Again, motion is different from Idem or the Same. It is therefore
      <i>not the same</i>. Yet still motion <i>is the same</i>; because
      every thing partakes of identity, or is the same with itself.
      Motion therefore both <i>is</i> the same and <i>is not</i> the
      same. We must not scruple to advance both these propositions. Each
      of them stands on its own separate ground.<a

      Diversum or The Different; in other words, it <i>is not</i>
      different, yet still it <i>is</i> different. And, lastly, motion
      is different from Ens, in other words, <i>it is not Ens</i>, or
      is non-Ens: yet still <i>it is Ens</i>, because it partakes of
      existence. Hence motion is both Ens, and Non-Ens.</p>

      Here we arrive at Plato&#8217;s explanation of Non-Ens, &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957;: the
      main problem which he is now setting to himself. Non-Ens is
      equivalent to, <i>different from Ens</i>. It is the Form or Idea
      of Diversum, considered in reference to Ens. Every thing is Ens,
      or partakes of entity, or existence. Every thing also is different
      from Ens, or partakes of difference in relation to Ens: it is thus
      Non-Ens. Every thing therefore is at the same time both Ens, and
      Non-Ens. Nay, Ens itself, inasmuch as it is different from all
      other things, is Non-Ens in reference to them. It is Ens only as
      one, in reference to itself: but it is Non-Ens an infinite number
      of times, in reference to all other things.<a

      not designate any thing contrary to what is meant by that name,

      I say nothing about contrariety (concludes Plato), or about any
      thing contrary to Ens; nor will I determine whether Non-Ens in
      this sense be rationally possible or not. What I mean by Non-Ens
      is a particular case under the general doctrine of the communion
      or combination of Forms: the combination of Ens with Diversum,
      composing that which is different from Ens, and which is therefore
      Non-Ens. Thus Ens itself, being different from all other Forms, is
      Non-Ens in reference to them all, or an indefinite number of times<a

      Non-Ens being thus shown to be one among the many other Forms,
      disseminated among all the others, and entering into communion
      with Ens among the rest &#8212; we have next to enquire whether it
      enters into communion with the Form of Opinion and Discourse. It
      is the communion of the two which constitutes false opinion and
      false proposition: if therefore such communion be possible, false
      opinion and false proposition are possible, which is the point
      that Plato is trying to prove.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_120"

    <p>
      Now it has been already stated (continues Plato) that some Forms
      or Genera admit of communion with each other, others do not. In
      like manner some words admit of communion with each other &#8212; not
      others. Those alone admit of communion, which, when put together,
      make up a proposition significant or giving information respecting
      Essence or Existence. The smallest proposition must have a noun
      and a verb put together: the noun indicating the agent, the verb
      indicating the act. Every proposition must be a proposition
      concerning something, or must have a logical subject: every
      proposition must also be of a certain quality. Let us take (he
      proceeds) two simple propositions: <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is
        sitting down</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying.</i><a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_121" href="#Footnotev3_29_121"><span
          class="sp">121</span></a> Of both these two, the subject is
      the same: but the first is true, the second is false. The first
      gives things existing as they are, respecting the subject: the
      second gives respecting the subject, things different from those
      existing, or in other words things non-existent, as if they did
      exist.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_122" href="#Footnotev3_29_122"><span

        &#8212; Plato does not recognise the predicate.</span></p>
    <p>
      The foregoing is Plato&#8217;s explanation of Non-Ens. Before we remark
      upon it, let us examine his mode of analysing a proposition. He
      conceives the proposition as consisting of a noun and a verb. The
      noun marks the logical <i>subject</i>, but he has no technical
      word equivalent to <i>subject</i>: his phrase is, that a
      proposition must be <i>of something</i> or <i>concerning
        something</i>. Then again, he not only has no word to designate
      the predicate, but he does not even seem to conceive the predicate
      as distinct and separable: it stands along with the copula
      embodied in the verb. The two essentials of a proposition, as he
      states them, are &#8212; That it should have a certain subject &#8212; That it
      should be of a certain quality, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page236" id="v3page236"></a>236</span>true or false.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_124" href="#Footnotev3_29_124"><span
          class="sp">124</span></a> This conception is just, as far as
      it goes: but it does not state all which ought to be known about
      proposition, and it marks an undeveloped logical analysis. It
      indicates moreover that Plato, not yet conceiving the predicate as
      a distinct constituent, had not yet conceived the copula as such:
      and therefore that the substantive verb &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; had not yet been
      understood by him in its function of pure and simple copula. The
      idea that the substantive verb when used in a proposition must
      mark <i>existence</i> or <i>essence</i>, is sufficiently
      apparent in several of his reasonings.</p>

        Since the time of Aristotle, the <i>quality</i> of a
        proposition has been understood to designate its being either
        affirmative or negative: that being <i>formal</i>, or belonging
        to its form only. Whether affirmative or negative, it may be
        true or false: and this is doubtless a <i>quality</i>, but
        belonging to its matter, not to its form. Plato seems to have
        taken no account of the formal distinction, <i>negative</i> or
        <i>affirmative</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I shall now say a few words on Plato&#8217;s explanation of Non-Ens. It
      is given at considerable length, and was, in the judgment of
      Schleiermacher, eminently satisfactory to Plato himself. Some of
      Plato&#8217;s expressions<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_125"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a> lead
      me to suspect that his satisfaction was not thus unqualified: but
      whether he was himself satisfied or not, I cannot think that the
      explanation ought to satisfy others.</p>

        not satisfactory &#8212; Objections to it.</span></p>
    <p>
      Plato here lays down the position &#8212; That the word <i>Not</i>
      signifies nothing more than difference, with respect to that other
      word to which it is attached. It does not signify (he says) what
      is contrary; but simply what is different. <i>Not-great</i>, <i>Not-beautiful</i>
      &#8212; mean what is different from great or beautiful: Non-Ens means,
      not what is contrary to Ens, but simply what is different from
      Ens.</p>
    <p>
      First, then, even if we admit that Non-Ens has this latter meaning
      and nothing beyond &#8212; yet when we turn to Plato&#8217;s own definition of
      Ens, we shall find it so all-comprehensive, that there can be
      absolutely nothing different from Ens:&#8212; these last words can have
      no place and no meaning. Plato defines Ens so as to include all
      that is knowable, conceivable, thinkable.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_126" href="#Footnotev3_29_126"><span
          class="sp">126</span></a> One portion of this total differs
      from another: but there can be nothing which differs from it all.
      The Form or nature of Diversum (to <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page237" id="v3page237"></a>237</span>use Plato&#8217;s
      phrase) as it is among the knowable or conceivable, is already
      included in the total of Ens, and comes into communion (according
      to the Platonic phraseology) with one portion of that total as
      against another portion. But with Ens as a whole, it cannot come
      into communion, for there is nothing apart from Ens. Whenever we
      try to think of any thing apart from Ens, we do by the act of
      thought include it in Ens, as defined by Plato. <i>Different from
        great</i> &#8212; <i>different from white</i> (<i>i.e.</i> not great,
      not white, sensu Platonico) is very intelligible: but <i>Different
        from Ens</i>, is not intelligible: there is nothing except the
      inconceivable and incomprehensible: the words professing to
      describe it, are mere unmeaning sound. Now this is just<a

          class="sp">127</span></a> what Parmenides said about Non-Ens.
      Plato&#8217;s definition of Ens appears to me to make out the case of
      Parmenides about Non-Ens; and to render the Platonic explanation &#8212;
      <i>different from Ens</i> &#8212; open to quite as many difficulties, as
      those which attach to Non-Ens in the ordinary sense.</p>

      Secondly, there is an objection still graver against Plato&#8217;s
      explanation. When he resolves negation into an affirmation of
      something different from what is denied, he effaces or puts out of
      sight one of the capital distinctions of logic. What he says is
      indeed perfectly true: <i>Not-great</i>, <i>Not-beautiful</i>, <i>Non-Ens</i>,
      are respectively different from <i>great</i>, <i>beautiful</i>,
      <i>Ens</i>. But this, though true, is only a part of the truth;
      leaving unsaid another portion of the truth which, while equally
      essential, is at the same time special and characteristic. The
      negative not only differs from the affirmative, but has such
      peculiar meaning of its own, as to exclude the affirmative: both
      cannot be true together. <i>Not-great</i> is certainly different
      from <i>great</i>: so also, <i>white</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>rough</i>,
      <i>just</i>, <i>valiant</i>, &amp;c, are all different from <i>great</i>.
      But there is nothing in these latter epithets to exclude the
      co-existence of great. <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is great</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is white</i>; in the second of these two propositions I affirm
      something respecting The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus quite different from
      what I affirm in the first, yet nevertheless noway excluding what
      is affirmed in the first.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_128"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> The
      two propositions may both <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page238" id="v3page238"></a>238</span>be true. But
      when I say &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is dead</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is not dead</i>: here are two propositions which cannot both be
      true, from the very form of the words. To explain <i>not-great</i>,
      as Plato does, by saying that it means <i>only</i> something
      different from great,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_129"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a> is to
      suppress this peculiar meaning and virtue of the negative, whereby
      it simply excludes the affirmative, without affirming any thing in
      its place. Plato is right in saying that <i>not-great</i> does
      not affirm the <i>contrary</i> of great, by which he means <i>little</i>.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_130" href="#Footnotev3_29_130"><span
          class="sp">130</span></a> The negative does not affirm any
      thing: it simply denies. Plato seems to consider the negative as a
      species of affirmative:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_131"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a> only
      affirming something different from what is affirmed by the term
      which it accompanies. Not-Great, Not-Beautiful, Not-Just &#8212; he
      declares to be Forms just as real and distinct as Great,
      Beautiful, Just: only different from these latter. This, in my
      opinion, is a conception logically erroneous. Negative stands
      opposed to affirmative, as one of the modes of distributing both
      terms and propositions. A purely negative term cannot stand alone
      in the subject of a proposition: <i>Non-Entis nulla sunt
        pr&aelig;dicata</i> &#8212; was <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page239" id="v3page239"></a>239</span>the scholastic
      maxim. The apparent exceptions to this rule arise only from the
      fact, that many terms negative in their form have taken on an
      affirmative signification.</p>

        Proklus here adopts and repeats Plato&#8217;s erroneous idea of the
        negative proposition and its function. When I deny that Caius is
        just, wise, &amp;c., my denial does not intimate simply that I
        know him to be something <i>different</i> from just, wise; for
        he may have fifty <i>different</i> attributes, co-existent and
        consistent with justice and wisdom. </p>

        To employ the language of Aristotle (see a pertinent example,
        Physic. i. 8, 191, b. 15, where he distinguishes &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217;
        &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056; from &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;), we may say that it is not
        of the essence of the Different to deny or exclude that from
        which it is different: the Different may deny or exclude, but
        that is only by <i>accident</i> &#8212; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;. Plato
        includes, in the essence of the Different, that which belongs to
        it only by accident.</p>
      <p>
        Aristotle in more than one place distinguishes &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8048; from
        &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; not always in the same language. In Metaphysic. I.
        p. 1055 a. 33, he considers that the root of all &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; is
        &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#962; and &#963;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, understood in the widest sense, <i>i.e.</i>
        affirmative and negative. See Bonitz, not. ad loc., and Waitz,
        ad Categor. p. 12, a. 26. The last portion of the treatise &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
        &#7961;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; was interpreted by Syrianus with a view to uphold
        Plato&#8217;s opinion here given in the Sophistes (Schol. ad Aristot.

        erroneous. Logical maxim of contradiction.</span></p>
    <p>
      The view which Plato here takes of the negative deserves the
      greater notice, because, if it were adopted, what is called the
      maxim of contradiction would be divested of its universality.
      Given a significant proposition with the same subject and the same
      predicate, each taken in one and the same signification &#8212; its
      affirmative and its negative cannot both be true. But if by the
      negative, you mean to make a new affirmation, different from that
      contained in the affirmative &#8212; the maxim just stated cannot be
      broadly maintained as of universal application: it may or may not
      be valid, as the case happens to stand. The second affirmation may
      be, as a matter of fact, incompatible with the first: but this is
      not to be presumed, from the mere fact that it is different from
      the first: proof must be given of such incompatibility.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_76"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_76"></a>Examination of the illustrative
        propositions chosen by Plato &#8212; How do we know that one is true,
        the other false?</span></p>
    <p>
      We may illustrate this remark by looking at the two propositions
      which Plato gives as examples of true and false. <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying</i>.
      Both the examples are of affirmative propositions: and it seems
      clear that Plato, in all this reasoning, took no account of
      negative propositions: those which simply deny, affirming nothing.
      The second of these propositions (says Plato) affirms <i>what is
        not</i>, as if it were, respecting the subject But how do we
      know this to be so? In the form of the second proposition there is
      nothing to show it: there is no negation of any thing, but simply
      affirmation of a different positive attribute. Although it
      happens, in this particular case, that the two attributes are
      incompatible, and that the affirmation of the one includes the
      negation of the other &#8212; yet there is nothing in the form of either
      proposition to deny the other:&#8212; no formal incompatibility between
      them. Both are alike affirmative, with the same subject, but
      different predicates. These two propositions therefore do not
      serve to illustrate the real nature of the negative, which
      consists precisely in this formal incompatibility. The proper
      negative belonging to the proposition &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; would be, <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is not
        sitting down</i>. Plato ought to maintain, if he followed out
      his previous <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page240"
          id="v3page240"></a>240</span>argument, that Not-Sitting down
      is as good a Form as Sitting-down, and that it meant merely &#8212;
      Different from Sitting down. But instead of doing this Plato gives
      us a new affirmative proposition, which, besides what it affirms,
      conceals an implied negation of the first proposition. This does
      not serve to illustrate the purpose of his reasoning &#8212; which was
      to set up the formal negative as a new substantive attribute,
      different from its corresponding affirmative. As between the two,
      the maxim of contradiction applies: both cannot be true. But as
      between the two propositions given in Plato, that maxim has no
      application: they are two propositions with the same subject, but
      different predicates; which happen in this case to be, the one
      true, the other false &#8212; but which are not formally incompatible.
      The second is not false because it differs from the first; it has
      no essential connection with the first, and would be equally
      false, even if the first were false also.</p>
    <p>
      The function of the negative is to deny. Now denial is not a
      species of affirmation, but the reversal or antithesis of
      affirmation: it nullifies a belief previously entertained, or
      excludes one which might otherwise be entertained, &#8212; but it
      affirms nothing. In particular cases, indeed, the denial of one
      thing may be tantamount to the affirmation of another: for a man
      may know that there are only two suppositions possible, and that
      to shut out the one is to admit the other. But this is an
      inference drawn in virtue of previous knowledge possessed and
      contributed by himself: another man without such knowledge would
      not draw the same inference, nor could he learn it from the
      negative proposition <i>per se</i>. Such then is the genuine
      meaning of the negative; from which Plato departs, when he tells
      us that the negative is a kind of affirmation, only affirming
      something different &#8212; and when he illustrates it by producing two
      affirmative propositions respecting the same subject, affirming
      different attributes, the one as matter of fact incompatible with
      the other.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_77"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_77"></a>Necessity of accepting the evidence
        of sense.</span></p>
    <p>
      But how do we know that the first proposition &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; affirms what is:&#8212; and that the second
      proposition &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying</i> &#8212; affirms
      what is not? If present, our senses testify to us the truth of the
      first, and the falsehood of the second: if absent, we have the
      testimony of a witness, combined with our own past experience <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page241" id="v3page241"></a>241</span>attesting
      the frequency of facts analogous to the one, and the
      non-occurrence of facts analogous to the other. When we make the
      distinction, then, &#8212; we assume that what is attested by sense or
      by comparisons and inductions from the facts of sense, is real, or
      <i>is</i>: and that what is merely conceived or imagined, without
      the attestation of sense (either directly or by way of induction),
      is not real, or <i>is not</i>. Upon this assumption Plato himself
      must proceed, when he takes it for granted, as a matter of course,
      that the first proposition is true, and the second false. But he
      forgets that this assumption contradicts the definition which, in
      this same dialogue,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_132"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> he had
      himself given of Ens &#8212; of the real or <i>the thing that is</i>.
      His definition was so comprehensive, as to include not only all
      that could be seen or felt, but also all that had capacity to be
      known or conceived by the mind: and he speaks very harshly of
      those who admit the reality of things perceived, but refuse to
      admit equal reality to things only conceived. Proceeding then upon
      this definition, we can allow no distinction as to truth or
      falsehood between the two propositions &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying</i>:
      the predicate of the second affirms what is, just as much as the
      predicate of the first: for it affirms something which, though
      neither perceived nor perceivable by sense, is distinctly
      conceivable and conceived by the mind. When Plato takes for
      granted the distinction between the two, that the first affirms <i>what
        is</i>, and the second <i>what is not</i> &#8212; he unconsciously
      slides into that very recognition of the testimony of sense (in
      other words, of fact and experience), as the certificate of
      reality, which he had so severely denounced in the opposing
      materialist philosophers: and upon the ground of which he thought
      himself entitled, not merely to correct them as mistaken, but to
      reprove them as wicked and impudent.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_133"

        partly on the imperfect formal logic of that day.</span></p>
    <p>
      I have thus reviewed a long discussion &#8212; terminating in a
      conclusion which appears to me unsatisfactory &#8212; of the meaning and
      function of the negative. I hardly think that Plato would have
      given such an explanation of it, if he had had the opportunity of
      studying the Organon of Aristotle. Prior to Aristotle, the principles and distinctions of formal logic were hardly <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page242" id="v3page242"></a>242</span>at
      all developed; nor can we wonder that others at that time fell
      into various errors which Plato scornfully derides, but very
      imperfectly rectifies. For example, Antisthenes did not admit the
      propriety of any predication, except identical, or at most
      essential, predication: the word &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; appeared to him
      incompatible with any other. But we perceive in this dialogue,
      that Plato also did not conceive the substantive verb as
      performing the simple function of copula in predication: on the
      contrary he distinguishes &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, as marking identity between
      subject and predicate &#8212; from &#956;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;, as marking accidental
      communion between the two. Again, there were men in Plato&#8217;s day
      who maintained that Non-Ens (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957;) was inconceivable and
      impossible. Plato, in refuting these philosophers, gives a
      definition of Ens (&#964;&#8056; &#8002;&#957;), which puts them in the right &#8212; fails in
      stating what the true negative is &#8212; and substitutes, in place of
      simple denial, a second affirmation to overlay and supplant the
      first.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_29_79"
          id="Sidenotev3_29_79"></a>Doctrine of the Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212;
        contradicts that of other Platonic dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>
      To complete the examination of this doctrine of the
      Sophist&ecirc;s, respecting Non-Ens, we must compare it with the
      doctrine on the same subject laid down in other Platonic
      dialogues. It will be found to contradict, very distinctly, the
      opinion assigned by Plato to Sokrates both in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and in the fifth Book of the Republic:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_134" href="#Footnotev3_29_134"><span
          class="sp">134</span></a> where Sokrates deals with Non-Ens in
      its usual <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page243"
          id="v3page243"></a>243</span>sense as the negation of Ens:
      laying down the position that Non-Ens can be neither the object of
      the cognizing Mind, nor the object of the opining (&#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#969;&#957;) or
      cogitant Mind: that it is uncognizable and incogitable,
      correlating only with Non-Cognition or Ignorance. Now we find that
      this doctrine (of Sokrates, in The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and Republic)
      is the very same as that which is affirmed, in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s, to be taken up by the delusive Sophist: the same
      as that which the Eleate spends much ingenuity in trying to
      refute, by proving that Non-Ens is not the negation of Ens, but
      only that which differs from Ens, being itself a particular
      variety of Ens. It is also the same doctrine as is declared, both
      by the Eleate in the Sophist&ecirc;s and by Sokrates in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, to imply as an undeniable consequence, that
      the falsehood of any proposition is impossible. &#8220;A false
      proposition is that which speaks the thing that is not (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;).
      But this is an impossibility. You can neither know, nor think, nor
      speak, the thing that is not. You cannot know without knowing
      something: you cannot speak without speaking something (<i>i. e.</i>
      something that is).&#8221; Of this consequence &#8212; which is expressly
      announced as included in the doctrine, both by the Eleate in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s and by the Platonic Sokrates in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; no notice is taken in the Republic.<a

        Aristotle (De Interpretat. p. 21, a. 22) briefly expresses his
        dissent from an opinion, the same as what is given in the
        Platonic Sophist&ecirc;s &#8212; that &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957; is &#8004;&#957; &#964;&#953;. He makes no
        mention of Plato, but Ammonius in the Scholia alludes to Plato
        (p. 129, b. 20, Schol. Bekk.). </p>
      <p>
        We must note that the Eleate in the Sophist&ecirc;s states both
        opinions respecting &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;: first that which he refutes &#8212; next
        that which he advances. The Scholiast may, therefore, refer to
        both opinions, as <i>stated</i> in the Sophist&ecirc;s, though
        one of them is stated only for the purpose of being refuted.</p>
      <p>
        We may contrast with these views of Plato (in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s) respecting &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;, as not being a negation
        &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, but simply a something &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, the
        different views of Aristotle about &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;, set forth in the
        instructive Commentary of M. Ravaisson, Essai sur la
        M&eacute;taphysique d&#8217;Aristote, p. 360.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Le non-&ecirc;tre s&#8217;oppose &agrave; l&#8217;&ecirc;tre, comme sa
        n&eacute;gation: ce n&#8217;est donc pas, non plus que l&#8217;&ecirc;tre,
        une chose simple; et autant il y a de genres de l&#8217;&ecirc;tre,
        autant il faut que le non-&ecirc;tre ait de genres. Cependant
        l&#8217;opposition de l&#8217;&ecirc;tre et du non-&ecirc;tre,
        diff&eacute;rente, en realit&eacute;, dans chacune des
        cat&eacute;gories, est la m&ecirc;me dans toutes par sa forme.
        Dans cette forme, le second terme n&#8217;exprime pas autre chose que
        l&#8217;absence du premier. Le rapport de l&#8217;&ecirc;tre et du
        non-&ecirc;tre consiste donc dans une pure contradiction:
        derni&egrave;re forme &agrave; laquelle toute opposition doit se
        ramener.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Aristotle seems to allude to the Sophist&ecirc;s, though not
        mentioning it by its title, in three passages of the Metaphysica
        &#8212; E. 1026, b. 14; K. 1064, b. 29; N. 1089, a. 5 (see the note of
        Bonitz on the latter passage) &#8212; perhaps also elsewhere (see
        Ueberweg, pp. 153-154). Plato replied in one way, Leukippus and
        Demokritus in another, to the doctrine of Parmenides, who
        banished Non-Ens as incogitable. Leukippus maintained that
        Non-Ens equivalent to &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957;, and that the two elements of
        things were &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#962; and &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957;, for which he used the
        expressions &#948;&#8050;&#957; and &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#941;&#957;. Plato replied as we read in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s: thus both he and Leukippus tried in different
        ways to demonstrate a positive nature and existence for Non-Ens.
        See Aristot. Metaph. A. 985, b. 4, with the Scholia, p. 538,
        Brandis. The Scholiast cites Plato &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#928;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#8115;, which seems a
        mistake for &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#8131;.</p>

        Socher (Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, pp. 264-265) is upon this
        point more satisfactory than the other Platonic commentators. He
        points out &#8212; not only without disguise, but even with emphasis &#8212;
        the discrepancies and contradictions between the doctrines
        ascribed to the Eleate in the Sophist&ecirc;s, and those
        ascribed to Sokrates in the Republic, Ph&aelig;don, and other
        Platonic dialogues. These are the main premisses upon which
        Socher rests his inference, that the Sophist&ecirc;s is not the
        composition of Plato. I do not admit his inference: but the
        premisses, as matters of fact, appear to me undeniable.
        Stallbaum, in his Proleg. to the Sophist&ecirc;s, p. 40 seq.,
        attempts to explain away these discrepancies &#8212; in my opinion his
        remarks are obscure and unsatisfactory. Various other
        commentators, also holding the Sophist&ecirc;s to be a genuine
        work of Plato, overlook or extenuate these premisses, which they
        consider unfavourable to that conclusion. Thus Alkinous, in his
        &#917;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;, sets down the explanation of &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; which is given
        in the Sophist&ecirc;s, as if it were the true and Platonic
        explanation, not adverting to what is said in the Republic and
        elsewhere (Alkin. c. 35, p. 189 in the Appendix Platonica
        annexed to the edition of Plato by K. F. Hermann). The like
        appears in the &#928;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;: c. 21, p.
        215 of the same edition. Proklus, in his Commentary on the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s, speaks in much the same manner about &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957;
        &#8212; considering the doctrine advanced and defended by the Eleate
        in the Sophist&ecirc;s, to represent the opinion of Plato (p.
        785 ed. Stallbaum; see also the Commentary of Proklus on the
        Tim&aelig;us, b. iii. p. 188 E, 448 ed. Schneid.). So likewise
        Simplikius and the commentators on Aristotle, appear to consider
        it &#8212; see Schol. ad Aristotel. Physica, p. 332, a. 8, p. 333, b.,
        334, a., 343, a. 5. It is plain from these Scholia that the
        commentators were much embarrassed in explaining &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;. They
        take the Sophist&ecirc;s as if it delivered Plato&#8217;s decisive
        opinion upon that point (Porphyry compares what Plato says in
        the Tim&aelig;us, but not what he says in the Republic or in
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, p. 333, b. 25); and I think that they
        accommodate Plato to Aristotle, in such manner as to obscure the
        real antithesis which Plato insists upon in the Sophist&ecirc;s
        &#8212; I mean the antithesis according to which Plato excludes what
        is &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; and admits only what is &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;.</p>
      <p>
        Ritter gives an account (Gesch. der Philos. part ii. pp.
        288-289) of Plato&#8217;s doctrine in the Sophist&ecirc;s respecting
        Non-Ens; but by no means an adequate account. K. F. Hermann also
        omits (Geschichte und System der Platonischen Philos. pp.
        504-505-507) to notice the discrepancy between the doctrine of
        the Sophist&ecirc;s, and the doctrine of the Republic, and
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, respecting &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957; &#8212; though he
        pronounces elsewhere that the Republic is among the most
        indisputably positive of all Plato&#8217;s compositions (p. 536).</p>

    <p>
      Again, the doctrine maintained by the Eleate in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s respecting Ens, as well as respecting Ideas or
      Forms, is in other ways inconsistent with what is laid down in
      other Platonic dialogues. The Eleate in the Sophist&ecirc;s
      undertakes to refute two different classes of opponents; first,
      the Materialists, of whom he speaks with derision and antipathy &#8212;
      secondly, others of very opposite doctrines, whom he denominates
      the Friends of Ideas or Forms, speaking of them in terms of great
      respect. Now by these Friends of Forms or Ideas, Schleiermacher
      conjectures that Plato intends to denote the Megaric philosophers.
      M. Cousin, and most other critics (except Ritter), have taken up
      this opinion. But to me it seems that Socher is right in declaring
      the doctrine, ascribed to these Friends of Ideas, to be the very
      same as that which is laid down by Plato himself in other
      important dialogues &#8212; Republic, Tim&aelig;us, Ph&aelig;don,
      Ph&aelig;drus, Kratylus, &amp;c. &#8212; and which is generally
      understood as that of the Platonic Ideas.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_136" href="#Footnotev3_29_136"><span
          class="sp">136</span></a> In all these dialogues, the capital
      contrast and antithesis <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page245"
          id="v3page245"></a>245</span>is that between Ens or Entia on
      one side, and Fientia (the transient, ever generated and ever
      perishing), on the other: between the eternal, unchangeable,
      archetypal Forms or Ideas &#8212; and the ever-changing flux of
      particulars, wherein approximative likeness of these archetypes is
      imperfectly manifested. Now it is exactly this antithesis which
      the Friends of Forms in the Sophist&ecirc;s are represented as
      upholding, and which the Eleate undertakes to refute.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_137" href="#Footnotev3_29_137"><span
          class="sp">137</span></a> We shall find Aristotle, over and
      over again, impugning the total separation or demarcation between
      Ens and Fientia (&#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; &#8212; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#8212; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;), both as the
      characteristic dogma, and the untenable dogma, of the Platonic
      philosophy: it is exactly the same issue which the Eleate in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s takes with the Friends of Forms. He proves that
      Ens is just as full of perplexity, and just as difficult to
      understand, as Non-Ens:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_138"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a>
      whereas, in the other Platonic dialogues, Ens is <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page246" id="v3page246"></a>246</span>constantly
      spoken of as if it were plain and intelligible. In fact, he breaks
      down the barrier between Ens and Fientia, by including motion,
      change, the moving or variable, among the world of Entia.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_139" href="#Footnotev3_29_139"><span
          class="sp">139</span></a> Motion or Change belongs to Fieri;
      and if it be held to belong to Esse also (by recognising a Form or
      Idea of Motion or Change, as in the Sophist&ecirc;s), the
      antithesis between the two, which is so distinctly declared in
      other Platonic dialogues, disappears.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_140"

        Socher, p. 266; Schleiermacher, Einleitung zum Sophistes, p.
        134; Cousin, &#338;uvres de Platon, vol. xi. 517, notes.</p>
      <p>
        Schleiermacher gives this as little more than a conjecture; and
        distinctly admits that any man may easily suppose the doctrine
        ascribed to these Friends of Forms to be Plato&#8217;s own doctrine &#8212;
        &#8220;Nicht zu verwundern w&auml;re es, wenn Mancher auf den Gedanken
        k&auml;me, Platon meinte hier sich selbst und seine eigene
        Lehre,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>
      <p>
        But most of the subsequent critics have taken up
        Schleiermacher&#8217;s conjecture (that the Megarici are intended), as
        if it were something proved and indubitable.</p>
      <p>
        It is curious that while Schleiermacher thinks that the opinions
        of the Megaric philosophers are impugned and refuted in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s, Socher fancies that the dialogue was composed
        by a Megaric philosopher, not by Plato. Ueberweg (Aechtheit der
        Platon. Schr. pp. 275-277) points out as explicitly as Socher,
        the discrepancy between the Sophist&ecirc;s and several other
        Platonic dialogues, in respect to what is said about Forms or
        Ideas. But he draws a different inference: he infers from it a
        great change in Plato&#8217;s own opinion, and he considers that the
        Sophist&ecirc;s is later in its date of composition than those
        other dialogues which it contradicts. I think this opinion about
        the late composition of the Sophist&ecirc;s, is not improbable;
        but the premisses are not sufficient to prove it.</p>
      <p>
        My view of the Platonic Sophist&ecirc;s differs from the
        elaborate criticism on it given by Steinhart (Einleitung zum
        Soph. p. 417 seq.) Moreover, there is one assertion in that
        Einleitung which I read with great surprise. Steinhart not only
        holds it for certain that the Sophistes was composed after the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s, but also affirms that it solves the
        difficulties propounded in the Parmenid&ecirc;s &#8212; discusses the
        points of difficulty &#8220;in the best possible way&#8221; (&#8220;in der
        w&uuml;nschenwerthesten Weise&#8221; (pp. 470-471).</p>
      <p>
        I confess I cannot find that the difficulties started in the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s are even noticed, much less solved, in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s. And Steinhart himself tells that the
        Parmenid&ecirc;s places us in a circle both of persons and
        doctrines entirely different from those of the Sophist&ecirc;s
        (p. 472). It is plain also that the other Platonic commentators
        do not agree with Steinhart in finding the Sophist&ecirc;s a key
        to the Parmenid&ecirc;s: for most of them (Ast, Hermann, Zeller,
        Stallbaum, Brandis, &amp;c.) consider the Parmenid&ecirc;s to
        have been composed at a later date than the Sophist&ecirc;s (as
        Steinhart himself intimates; compare his Einleitung zum
        Parmenides, p. 312 seq.). Ueberweg, the most recent enquirer
        (posterior to Steinhart), regards the Parmenid&ecirc;s as the
        latest of all Plato&#8217;s compositions &#8212; if indeed it be genuine, of
        which he rather doubts. (Aechtheit der Platon. Schrift. pp.
        182-183.) </p>
      <p>
        M. Mallet (Histoire de l&#8217;&Eacute;cole de Megare, Introd. pp.
        xl.-lviii., Paris, 1845) differs from all the three opinions of
        Schleiermacher, Ritter, and Socher. He thinks that the
        philosophers, designated as Friends of Forms, are intended for
        the Pythagoreans. His reasons do not satisfy me.</p>

        and intelligible doctrine which will do credit to Plato, and to

        impugned by Parmenides. Nevertheless in an earlier passage of

        among the &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; (p. 129 E). It will be found, however, that when
        Parmenides comes to question Sokrates, What &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; do you
        recognise? attributes and subjects only (the latter with
        hesitation) are included: no such thing as actions, processes,

          id="Sidenotev3_29_80"></a>The persons whom Plato here attacks
        as Friends of Forms are those who held the same doctrine as
        Plato himself espouses in Ph&aelig;don, Republic, &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>
      If we examine the reasoning of the Eleate, in the Sophist&ecirc;s,
      against the persons whom he calls the Friends of Forms, we shall
      see that these latter are not Parmenideans only, but also Plato
      himself in the Ph&aelig;don, Republic, and elsewhere. We shall
      also see that the ground, taken up by the Eleate, is much the same
      as that which was afterwards taken up by Aristotle against the
      Platonic Ideas. Plato, in most of his dialogues, declares Ideas,
      Forms, Entia, to be eternal substances distinct and apart from the
      flux and movement of particulars: yet he also declares,
      nevertheless, that particulars have a certain communion or
      participation with the Ideas, and are discriminated and
      denominated according to such participation. Aristotle controverts
      both these doctrines: <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page247"
          id="v3page247"></a>247</span>first, the essential separation
      of the two, which he declares to be untrue: next, the
      participation or coming together of the two separate elements &#8212;
      which he declares to be an unmeaning fiction or poetical metaphor,
      introduced in order to elude the consequences of the original
      fallacy.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_141" href="#Footnotev3_29_141"><span
          class="sp">141</span></a> He maintains that the two (Entia and
      Fientia &#8212; Universals and Particulars) have no reality except in
      conjunction and implication together; though they are separable by
      reason (&#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179; &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8048; &#8212; &#964;&#8183; &#949;&#7984;&#957;&#945;&#953;, &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;) or abstraction, and
      though we may reason about them apart, and must often reason about
      them apart.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_142" href="#Footnotev3_29_142"><span
          class="sp">142</span></a> Now it is this implication and
      conjunction of the Universal with its particulars, which is the
      doctrine of the Sophist&ecirc;s, and which distinguishes it from
      other Platonic dialogues, wherein the Universal is
      transcendentalized &#8212; lodged in a separate world from particulars.
      No science or intelligence is possible (says the Eleate in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s) either upon the theory of those who pronounce all
      Ens to be constant and unchangeable, or upon that of those who
      declare all Ens to be fluent and variable. We must recognise both
      together, the constant and the variable, as equally real and as
      making up the totality of Ens.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_143"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a> This
      result, though not stated in the language which Aristotle would
      have employed, coincides very nearly with the Aristotelian
      doctrine, in one of the main points on which Aristotle
      distinguishes his own teaching from that of his master.</p>

        Platonic point of view, and approaches the Aristotelian.</span></p>
    <p>
      That the Eleate in the Sophistes recedes from the Platonic point
      of view and approaches towards the Aristotelian, will be seen also
      if we look at the lesson of logic which he gives to
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. In his analysis of a proposition &#8212; and in
      discriminating such conjunctions of <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page248" id="v3page248"></a>248</span>words as are
      significant, from such as are insignificant &#8212; he places himself on
      the same ground as that which is travelled over by Aristotle in
      the Categories and the treatise De Interpretatione. That the
      handling of the topic by Aristotle is much superior, is what we
      might naturally expect from the fact that he is posterior in time.
      But there is another difference between the two which is important
      to notice. Aristotle deals with this topic, as he does with every
      other, in the way of methodical and systematic exposition. To
      expound it as a whole, to distribute it into convenient portions
      each illustrating the others, to furnish suitable examples for the
      general principles laid down &#8212; are announced as his distinct
      purposes. Now Plato&rsquo;s manner is quite different. Systematic
      exposition is not his primary purpose: he employs it up to a
      certain point, but as means towards another and an independent
      purpose &#8212; towards the solution of a particular difficulty, which
      has presented itself in the course of the dialogue. &#8212; &#8220;<i>Nosti
        morem dialogorum.</i>&#8221; Aristotle is demonstrative: Plato is
      dialectical. In our present dialogue (the Sophist&ecirc;s), the
      Eleate has been giving a long explanation of Non-Ens; an
      explanation intended to prove that Non-Ens was a particular sort
      of Ens, and that there was therefore no absurdity (though
      Parmenides had said that this was absurdity) in assuming it as a
      passable object of Cognition, Opination, Affirmation. He now goes
      a step further, and seeks to show that it is, actually and in
      fact, an object of Opination and Affirmation.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_144" href="#Footnotev3_29_144"><span
          class="sp">144</span></a> It is for this purpose, and for this

      Accordingly, the Eleate, &#8212; after pointing out that neither a
      string of nouns repeated one after the other, nor a string of
      verbs so repeated, would form a significant proposition, &#8212;
      declares that the conjunction of a noun with a verb is required to
      form one; and that opination is nothing but that internal mental
      process which the words of the proposition express. The smallest

      must be a proposition <i>of something</i>; and it must be of a

      proposition (in his time there were no technical terms of logic)
      must be something positive, and cannot be negative: by the quality

        In the words here cited Plato unconsciously slides back into the
        ordinary acceptation of &#956;&#942; &#964;&#953;: that is, to &#956;&#8052; in the sense of
        negation. If we adopt that peculiar sense of &#956;&#942;, which the
        Eleate has taken so much pains to prove just before in the case
        of &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8002;&#957; (that is, if we take &#956;&#8052; as signifying not negation
        but simply difference), the above argument will not hold. If &#964;&#943;&#962;
        signifies one subject (A), and &#956;&#942; &#964;&#953;&#962; signifies simply another
        subject (B) different from A (&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;), the predicate &#7936;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;
        cannot be affirmed. But if we take &#956;&#942; &#964;&#953;&#962; in its proper sense of
        negation, the &#7936;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; will be so far true that &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;, &#959;&#8016;
        &#920;&#949;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;, cannot be the subject of a proposition. Aristotle
        says the same in the beginning of the Treatise De

          id="Sidenotev3_29_83"></a>Plato in the Sophist&ecirc;s has
        undertaken an impossible task &#8212; He could not have proved,
        against his supposed adversary, that there <i>are</i> false
        propositions.</span></p>
    <p>
      The proceeding of Plato in the Sophist&ecirc;s is different. He
      supposes a Sophist who maintains that no proposition either is
      false or can be false, and undertakes to prove against him that
      there are false propositions: he farther supposes this antagonist
      to reject the evidence of sense and visible analogies, and to
      acknowledge no proof except what is furnished by reason and
      philosophical deduction.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_149"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
      Attempting, under these restrictions, to prove his point, Plato&#8217;s
      Eleatic disputant rests entirely upon the peculiar meaning which
      he professes to have shown to attach to Non-Ens. He <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page250" id="v3page250"></a>250</span>applies
      this to prove that Non-Ens may be predicated as well as Ens:
      assuming that such predication of Non-Ens constitutes a false
      proposition. But the proof fails. It serves only to show that the
      peculiar meaning ascribed by the Eleate to Non-Ens is
      inadmissible. The Eleate compares two distinct propositions &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is sitting down</i> &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is flying</i>.
      The first is true: the second is false. Why? Because (says the
      Eleate) the first predicates Ens, the second predicates Non-Ens,
      or (to substitute his definition of Non-Ens) another Ens different
      from the Ens predicated in the first.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_150"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_150"><span class="sp">150</span></a> But
      here the reason assigned, why the second proposition is false, is
      not the real reason. Many propositions may be assigned, which
      predicate attributes different from the first, but which are
      nevertheless quite as much true as the first. I have already
      observed, that the reason why the second proposition is false is,
      because it contradicts the direct testimony of sense, if the
      persons debating are spectators: if they are not spectators, then
      because it contradicts the sum total of their previous sensible
      experience, remembered, compared, and generalised, which has
      established in them the conviction that no man does or can fly. If
      you discard the testimony of sense as unworthy of credit (which
      Plato assumes the Sophist to do), you cannot prove that the second
      proposition is false &#8212; nor indeed that the first proposition is
      true. Plato has therefore failed in giving that dialectic proof
      which he promised. The Eleate is forced to rely (without formally
      confessing it), on the testimony of sense, which he had forbidden
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus to invoke, twenty pages before.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_151" href="#Footnotev3_29_151"><span
          class="sp">151</span></a> The long intervening piece of
      dialectic about Ens and Non-Ens is inconclusive for his purpose,
      and might have been omitted. The proposition &#8212; <i>The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus
        is flying</i> &#8212; does undoubtedly predicate attributes <i>which
        are not</i> as if they were,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_152"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a> and is
      thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page251" id="v3page251"></a>251</span>false.
      But then we must consult and trust the evidence of our perception:
      we must farther accept <i>are not</i> in the ordinary sense of
      the words, and not in the sense given to them by the Eleate in the
      Platonic Sophist&ecirc;s. His attempt to banish the specific
      meaning of the negative particle, and to treat it as signifying
      nothing more than difference, appears to me fallacious.<a

        Plato, Sophist. p. 240 A. It deserves note that here Plato
        presents to us the Sophist as rejecting the evidence of sense:
        in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus he presents to us the Sophist as
        holding the doctrine &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951; = &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;. How these propositions
        can both be true respecting the Sophists as a class I do not
        understand. The first may be true respecting some of them; the
        second may be true respecting others; respecting a third class
        of them, neither may be true. About the Sophists in a body there
        is hardly a single proposition which can be safely affirmed.</p>

        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus makes this attempt and is checked by the

        &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; may be false. The long interval between the two is

        The distinction between these two propositions, the first as

        with the distinction which Plato had so much insisted upon
        before respecting the intercommunion of Forms, Ideas, General
        Notions, &amp;c., that some Forms will come into communion with
        each other, while others will not (pp. 252-253). </p>
      <p>
        There is here no question of repugnancy or intercommunion of
        Forms: the question turns upon the evidence of vision, which
        informs us that The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus is sitting down and not
        standing up or flying. If any predicate be affirmed of a
        subject, contrary to what is included in the definition of that
        subject, then indeed repugnancy of Forms might be urged.</p>

        dialectic discussion.</span></p>
    <p>
      In all reasoning, nay in all communication by speech, you must
      assume that your hearer understands the meaning of what is spoken:
      that he has the feelings of belief and disbelief, and is familiar
      with those forms of the language whereby such feelings are
      expressed: that there are certain propositions which he believes &#8212;
      in other words, which he regards as true: that there are certain
      other propositions which he disbelieves, or regards as false: that
      he has had experience of the transition from belief to disbelief,
      and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> &#8212; in other words, of having fallen
      into error and afterwards come to perceive that it was error.
      These are the mental facts realised in each man and assumed by him
      to be also realised in his neighbours, when communication takes
      place by speech. If a man could be supposed to believe nothing,
      and to disbelieve nothing; &#8212; if he had no forms of speech to
      express his belief, disbelief, affirmation, and denial &#8212; no
      information could be given, no discussion would be possible. Every
      child has to learn this lesson in infancy; and a tedious lesson it
      undoubtedly is.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_154"

        belief and disbelief, expressed in set forms of words. They
        imply predication, which Antisthenes discarded.</span></p>
    <p>
      Discussion and theorising can only begin when these processes,
      partly intellectual, partly emotional, have become established and
      reproducible portions of the train of mental association. As
      processes, they are common to all men. But though two persons
      agree in having expressed the feeling of belief, and in expressing
      that feeling by one form of proposition &#8212; also in having the
      feeling of disbelief, and in expressing it by another form of
      proposition &#8212; yet it does not follow that the propositions which
      these two believe or disbelieve are the same. How far such is the
      case must be ascertained by comparison &#8212; by appeal to sense,
      memory, inference from analogy, induction, feeling, consciousness,
      &amp;c. The ground is now prepared for fruitful debate: for
      analysing the meaning, often confused and complicated, of
      propositions: for discriminating the causes, intellectual and
      emotional, of belief and disbelief, and for determining how far
      they harmonise in one mind and another: for setting out general
      rules as to sequence, or inconsistency, or independence, of one
      belief as compared with another. To a certain extent, the grounds
      of belief and disbelief in all men, and the grounds of consistency
      or inconsistency between some beliefs and others, will be found to
      harmonise: they can be embodied in methodical forms of language,
      and general rules can be laid down preventing in many cases
      inadvertence or erroneous combination. It is at this point that
      Aristotle takes up rational grammar and logic, with most
      profitable effect. But he is obliged to postulate (what
      Antisthenes professed to discard) predication, not merely
      identical, but also accidental as well as essential &#8212; together
      with names and propositions both negative and affirmative.<a

        schools of philosophers, none of whom would allow themselves to
        deserve the epithet of &#7936;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#953;.</p>

        partition, illustrated in the Sophist&ecirc;s.</span></p>
    <p>
      The long and varied predicamental series, given in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s, illustrates the process of logical partition, as
      Plato conceived it, and the definition of a class-name founded
      thereupon. You take a logical whole, and you subtract from it part
      after part until you find the <i>qu&aelig;situm</i> isolated from
      every thing else.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_156"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_156"><span class="sp">156</span></a> But
      you must always divide into two parts (he says) wherever it can be
      done: dichotomy or bipartition is the true logical partition:
      should this be impracticable, trichotomy, or division into the
      smallest attainable number of parts, must be sought for.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_157" href="#Footnotev3_29_157"><span
          class="sp">157</span></a> Moreover, the bipartition must be
      made according to Forms (Ideas, Kinds): the parts which you
      recognise must be not merely parts, but Forms: every form is a
      part, but every part is not a form.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_158"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_158"><span class="sp">158</span></a> Next,
      you must draw the line of division as nearly as you can through
      the middle of the <i>dividendum</i>, so that the parts on both
      sides may be nearly equal: it is in this way that your partition
      is most likely to coincide with forms on both sides of the line.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_159" href="#Footnotev3_29_159"><span
          class="sp">159</span></a> This is the longest way of
      proceeding, but the safest. It is a logical mistake to divide into
      two parts very unequal: you may find a form on one side of the
      line, but you obtain none on the other side. Thus, it is bad
      classification to distribute the human race into Hell&ecirc;nes +
      Barbari: the <i>Barbari</i> are of infinite number and diversity,
      having no one common form to which the name can apply. It is also
      improper to distribute Number into the myriad on side, and all
      other numbers on the other &#8212; for a similar reason. You ought to
      distribute the human <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page254"
          id="v3page254"></a>254</span>race into the two forms, Male &#8212;
      Female: and number into the two, Odd &#8212; Even.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_160" href="#Footnotev3_29_160"><span
          class="sp">160</span></a> So also, you must not divide
      gregarious creatures into human beings on one side, and animals on
      the other; because this last term would comprise numerous
      particulars utterly disparate. Such a classification is suggested
      only by the personal feeling of man, who prides himself upon his
      intelligence. But if the classification were framed by any other
      intelligent species, such as Cranes,<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_161"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_161"><span class="sp">161</span></a> they
      would distinguish Cranes on the one side from animals on the
      other, including Man as one among many disparate particulars under
      <i>animal</i>.</p>

        bipartition.</span></p>
    <p>
      The above-mentioned principle &#8212; dichotomy or bipartition into two
      equal or nearly equal halves, each resting upon a characteristic
      form &#8212; is to be applied as far as it will go. Many different
      schemes of partition upon this principle may be found, each
      including forms subordinated one to the other, descending from the
      more comprehensive to the less comprehensive. It is only when you
      can find no more parts which are forms, that you must be content
      to divide into parts which are not forms. Thus after all the
      characteristic forms, for dividing the human race, have been gone
      through, they may at last be partitioned into Hell&ecirc;nes and
      Barbari, Lydians and non-Lydians, Phrygians and non-Phrygians: in
      which divisions there is no guiding form at all, but only a
      capricious distribution into fractions with separate names<a

          class="sp">162</span></a> &#8212; meaning by <i>capricious</i>, a
      distribution founded on some feeling or circumstance peculiar to
      the distributor, or shared by him only with a few others; such as
      the fact, that he is himself a Lydian or a Phrygian, &amp;c.</p>

        Phil&ecirc;bus.</span></p>
    <p>
      These precepts in the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, respecting
      the process of classification, are illustrated by an important
      passage of the Phil&ecirc;bus:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_163"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_163"><span class="sp">163</span></a>
      wherein Plato tells us that the constitution of things includes
      the Determinate and the Indeterminate implicated with each other,
      and requiring study to disengage them. Between the highest One,
      Form, or Genus &#8212; and the lowest array of indefinite particulars &#8212;
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page255" id="v3page255"></a>255</span>there
      exist a certain number of intermediate Ones or Forms, each
      including more or fewer of these particulars. The process of study
      or acquired cognition is brought to bear upon these intermediate
      Forms: to learn how many there are, and to discriminate them in
      themselves as well as in their position relative to each other.
      But many persons do not recognise this: they apprehend only the
      Highest One, and the Infinite Many, not looking for any thing
      between: they take up hastily with some extreme and vague
      generality, below which they know nothing but particulars. With
      knowledge thus imperfect, you do not get beyond contentious
      debate. Real, instructive, dialectic requires an understanding of
      all the intermediate forms. But in descending from the Highest
      Form downwards, you must proceed as much as possible in the way of
      bipartition, or if not, then of tripartition, &amp;c.: looking for
      the smallest number of forms which can be found to cover the whole
      field. When no more forms can be found, then and not till then,
      you must be content with nothing better than the countless
      indeterminate particulars.</p>

        The notes of Dr. Badham upon this passage in his edition of the

    <p>
      This instructive passage of the Phil&ecirc;bus &#8212; while it brings
      to view a widespread tendency of the human mind, to pass from the
      largest and vaguest generalities at once into the region of
      particulars, and to omit the distinctive sub-classes which lie
      between &#8212; illustrates usefully the drift of the Sophist&ecirc;s
      and Politikus. In these two last dialogues it is the method itself
      of good logical distribution which Plato wishes to impress upon
      his readers: the formal part of the process.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_164" href="#Footnotev3_29_164"><span
          class="sp">164</span></a> With this view, he not only makes
      the process intentionally circuitous and diversified, but also
      selects by preference matters of common sensible experience,

        Partition on resemblances perceived by sense.</span></p>
    <p>
      The reasons given for this preference deserve attention. In these
      common matters (he tells us) the resemblances upon which Forms are
      founded are perceived by sense, and can be exhibited to every one,
      so that the form is readily understood and easily discriminated.
      The general terms can there be explained by reference to sense.
      But in regard to incorporeal matters, the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page256" id="v3page256"></a>256</span>higher and
      grander topics of discussion, there is no corresponding sensible
      illustration to consult. These objects can be apprehended only by
      reason, and described only by general terms. By means of these
      general terms, we must learn to give and receive rational
      explanations, and to follow by process of reasoning from one form
      to another. But this is more difficult, and requires a higher
      order of mind, where there are no resemblances or illustrations
      exposed to sense. Accordingly, we select the common sensible
      objects as an easier preparatory mode of a process substantially
      the same in both.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_166"

      This explanation given by Plato, in itself just, deserves to be

      (&#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;) sensible perception reaches only to the separate
      impressions of sense, and does not apprehend the likeness and
      other relations between them. I have also noticed the contrast
      which he establishes elsewhere between Esse and Fieri: <i>i.e.</i>,
      between Ens which alone (according to him) is knowable, and the
      perpetual flux of Fientia which is not knowable at all, but is
      only matter of opinion or guess-work. Now in the dialogue before
      us, the Politikus, there is no such marked antithesis between
      opinion and knowledge. Nor is the province of &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; so strictly
      confined: on the contrary, Plato here considers sensible
      perception as dealing with Entia, and as appreciating resemblances
      and other relations between them. It is by an attentive study and
      comparison of these facts of sense that Forms are detected. &#8220;When
      a man (he says) has first perceived by sense the points of
      communion between the Many, he must not desist from attentive
      observation until he has discerned in that communion all the
      differences which reside in Forms: and when <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page257" id="v3page257"></a>257</span>he has looked at
      the multifarious differences which are visible among these Many,
      he must not rest contented until he has confined all such as are
      really cognate within one resemblance, tied together by the
      essence of one common Form.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_168"

    <p>
      These passages may be compared with others of similar import in
      the Ph&aelig;drus.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_169"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_169"><span class="sp">169</span></a> Plato
      here considers the Form, not as an Entity <i>per se</i> separate
      from and independent of the particulars, but as implicated in and
      with the particulars: as a result reached by the mind through the
      attentive observation and comparison of particulars: as
      corresponding to what is termed in modern language abstraction and
      generalisation. The self-existent Platonic Ideas do not appear in
      the Politikus:<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_170"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_170"><span class="sp">170</span></a> which
      approximates rather to the Aristotelian doctrine:&#8212; that is, the
      doctrine of the universal, logically distinguishable from its
      particulars, but having no reality apart from them (&#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8048; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#8179;
      &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957;). But in other dialogues of Plato, the separation between
      the two is made as complete as possible, especially in the
      striking passages of the Republic: wherein we read that the facts
      of sense are a delusive juggle &#8212; that we must turn our back upon
      them and cease to study them &#8212; and that we must face about, away
      from the sensible world, to contemplate Ideas, the separate and
      unchangeable furniture of the intelligible world &#8212; and that the
      whole process of acquiring true Cognition, consists in passing
      from the higher to the lower Forms or Ideas, without any
      misleading illustrations of sense.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_171"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_171"><span class="sp">171</span></a> Here,
      in the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, instead of having the
      Universal behind our backs when the particulars are before our
      faces, we see it <i>in and amidst</i> particulars: the
      illustrations of sense, instead of deluding us, being declared to
      conduce, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page258" id="v3page258"></a>258</span>wherever
      they can be had, to the clearness and facility of the process.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_172" href="#Footnotev3_29_172"><span
          class="sp">172</span></a> Here, as well as in the
      Ph&aelig;drus, we find the process of Dialectic emphatically
      recommended, but described as consisting mainly in logical
      classification of particulars, ascending and descending divisions
      and conjunctions, as Plato calls them<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_173"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_173"><span class="sp">173</span></a> &#8212;
      analysis and synthesis. We are enjoined to divide and analyse the
      larger genera into their component species until we come to the
      lowest species which can no longer be divided: also, conversely,
      to conjoin synthetically the subordinate species until the highest
      genus is attained, but taking care not to omit any of the
      intermediate species, in their successive gradations.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_174" href="#Footnotev3_29_174"><span
          class="sp">174</span></a> Throughout all this process, as
      described both in the Ph&aelig;drus and in the Politikus, the eye
      is kept fixed upon the constituent individuals. The Form is
      studied in and among the particulars which it comprehends: the
      particulars are looked at in groups put together suitably to each
      comprehending Form. And in both dialogues, marked stress is laid
      upon the necessity of making the division dichotomous; as well as
      according to Forms, and not according to fractions which are not
      legitimate Forms.<a name="FnAnchorv3_29_175"
        href="#Footnotev3_29_175"><span class="sp">175</span></a> Any

      What distinguishes the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus from most
      other dialogues of Plato, is, that the method of logical
      classification is illustrated by setting the classifier to work
      upon one or a few given subjects, some in themselves trivial, some
      important. Though the principles of the method are enunciated in
      general terms, yet their application to the special example is
      kept constantly before us; so that we are never permitted, much
      less required, to divorce the Universal from its Particulars.</p>

        Parmenid&ecirc;s.</span></p>
    <p>
      As a dialogue illustrative of this method, the Politikus (as I <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page259" id="v3page259"></a>259</span>have
      already pointed out) may be compared to the Ph&aelig;drus: in
      another point of view, we shall find instruction in comparing it
      to the Parmenid&ecirc;s. This last too is a dialogue illustrative
      of method, but of a different variety of method.</p>

    <p>
      What the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus are for the enforcement of
      logical classification, the Parmenid&ecirc;s is for another part
      of the philosophising process &#8212; laborious evolution of all the
      consequences deducible from the affirmative as well as from the
      negative of every hypothesis bearing upon the problem. And we note
      the fact, that both in the Politikus and Parmenid&ecirc;s, Plato
      manifests the consciousness that readers will complain of him as
      prolix, tiresome, and wasting ingenuity upon unprofitable matters.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_29_176" href="#Footnotev3_29_176"><span
          class="sp">176</span></a> In the Parmenid&ecirc;s, he even
      goes the length of saying that the method ought only to be applied
      before a small and select audience; to most people it would be
      repulsive, since they cannot be made to comprehend the necessity
      for such circuitous preparation in order to reach truth.<a

        Objects measured against each other. Objects compared with a
        common standard. In each Art, the purpose to be attained is the
        standard.</span></p>
    <p>
      I. Plato assumes, that there will be critics who blame the two
      dialogues as too long and circuitous; excessive in respect of
      prolixity. In replying to those objectors,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_1" href="#Footnotev3_30_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
      he enquires, What is meant by long or short &#8212; excessive or
      deficient &#8212; great or little? Such expressions denote mensuration
      or comparison. But there are two varieties of mensuration. We may
      measure two objects one against the other: the first will be
      called great or greater, in relation to the second &#8212; the second
      will be called little or less in relation to the first. But we may
      also proceed in a different way. We may assume some third object
      as a standard, and then measure both the two against it: declaring
      the first to be great, greater, excessive, &amp;c., because it
      exceeds the standard &#8212; and the second to be little, less,
      deficient, &amp;c., because it falls short of the standard. Here
      then are two judgments or estimations altogether different from
      each other, and yet both denoted by the same words <i>great</i>
      and <i>little</i>: two distinct <i>essences</i> (in Platonic<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page261" id="v3page261"></a>261</span>
      phrase) of great and little, or of greatness and littleness.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_2" href="#Footnotev3_30_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      The art of mensuration has thus two varieties. One includes
      arithmetic and geometry, where we simply compare numbers and
      magnitudes with each other, determining the proportions between
      them: the other assumes some independent standard; above which is
      excess, and below which is deficiency. This standard passes by
      different names according to circumstances: the Moderate,
      Becoming, Seasonable, Proper, Obligatory, &amp;c.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_3" href="#Footnotev3_30_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
      Such a standard is assumed in every art &#8212; in every artistic or
      scientific course of procedure. Every art has an end to be
      attained, a result to be produced; which serves as the standard
      whereby each preparatory step of the artist is measured, and
      pronounced to be either excessive or deficient, as the case may
      be.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_4" href="#Footnotev3_30_4"><span
          class="sp">4</span></a> Unless such a standard be assumed, you
      cannot have regular art or science of any kind; neither in grave
      matters, nor in vulgar matters &#8212; neither in the government of
      society, nor in the weaving of cloth.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_5"

        defence of the Politikus against critics. Necessity that the
        critic shall declare explicitly what his standard of comparison
        is.</span></p>
    <p>
      The above-mentioned distinction between the two varieties of
      mensuration or comparison, is here given by Plato, simply to serve
      as a defence against critics who censured the peculiarities of the
      Politikus. It is not pursued into farther applications. But it
      deserves notice, not merely as being in itself just and useful,
      but as illustrating one of the many phases of Plato&#8217;s philosophy.
      It is an exhibition of the relative side of Plato&#8217;s character, as
      contra-distinguished from the absolute or dogmatical: for both the
      two, opposed as they are to each other, co-exist in him and
      manifest themselves alternately. It conveys a valuable lesson as
      to the apportionment of praise and blame. &#8220;When you blame me&#8221; (he
      says to his critics), &#8220;you must have in your mind some standard of
      comparison upon which the blame turns. Declare what that standard
      is:&#8212; what you mean by the Proper, Becoming, Moderate, &amp;c.
      There is such a standard, and a different one, in every different
      Art. What is it here? You must choose this standard, explain what
      it is, and adhere to it when you undertake to praise or blame.&#8221;
      Such an enunciation (thoroughly Sokratic<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_7"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>) of the
      principle of relativity, brings before critics the fact &#8212; which is
      very apt to be forgotten &#8212; that there must exist in the mind of
      each some standard of comparison, varying or unvarying, well or
      ill understood: while at the same time it enforces upon them the
      necessity of determining clearly for themselves, and announcing
      explicitly to others, what that standard is. Otherwise the
      propositions, affirming comparison, can have no uniform meaning
      with any two debaters, nor even with the same man at different
      times.</p>

        Protagoras, Ph&aelig;don, Phil&ecirc;bus, &amp;c.</span></p>
    <p>
      To this relative side of Plato&#8217;s mind belong his frequent
      commendations of measurement, numbering, computation, comparison,
      &amp;c. In the Protagoras,<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_8"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> he
      describes the art of measurement as the main guide and protector
      of human life: it is there treated as applicable to the correct
      estimation of pleasures and pains. In the Ph&aelig;don,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_9" href="#Footnotev3_30_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
      it is again extolled: though the elements to be calculated are
      there specified differently. In the Phil&ecirc;bus, the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page263" id="v3page263"></a>263</span>antithesis
      of &#928;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962; and &#7948;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957; (the Determinant or Limit, and the
      Indeterminate or Infinite) is one of the leading points of the
      dialogue. We read in it moreover a bipartite division of
      Mensuration or Arithmetic,<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_10"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> which is
      quite different from the bipartite division just cited out of the
      Politikus. Plato divides it there (in the Phil&ecirc;bus) into
      arithmetic for theorists, and arithmetic for practical life:
      besides which, he distinguishes the various practical arts as
      being more or less accurate, according as they have more or less
      of measurement and sensible comparison in them. Thus the art of
      the carpenter, who employs measuring instruments such as the line
      and rule &#8212; is more accurate than that of the physician, general,
      pilot, husbandman, &amp;c., who have no similar means of
      measuring. This is a classification quite different from what we
      find in the Politikus; yet tending in like manner to illustrate
      the relative point of view, and its frequent manifestation in
      Plato. In the Politikus, he seeks to refer praise and blame to a
      standard of measurement, instead of suffering them to be mere
      outbursts of sentiment unsystematic and unanalysed.</p>

        Procedure of Plato in subdividing.</span></p>
    <p>
      II. The second peculiarity to which I call attention in the
      Politikus, is the definition or description there furnished of the
      character so-called: that is, the Statesman, the King, Governor,
      Director, or Manager, of human society. At the outset of the
      dialogue, this person is declared to belong to the Genus &#8212; Men of
      Science or of Art (the two words are faintly distinguished in
      Plato). It is possession of the proper amount of scientific
      competence which constitutes a man a Governor: and which entitles
      him to be so named, whether he actually governs any society or
      not.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_11" href="#Footnotev3_30_11"><span
          class="sp">11</span></a> (This point of departure is purely
      Sokratic: for in the Memorabilia of Xenophon,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_12" href="#Footnotev3_30_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> Sokrates makes the same express
      declaration.) The King knows, but does not act: yet he is not a
      simple critic or spectator &#8212; he gives orders: and those orders are
      not suggested <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page264"
          id="v3page264"></a>264</span>to him by any one else (as in the
      case of the Herald, the Keleust&ecirc;s, and others),<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_13" href="#Footnotev3_30_13"><span
          class="sp">13</span></a> but spring from his own bosom and his
      own knowledge. From thence Plato carries us through a series of
      descending logical subdivisions, until we come to define the King
      as the shepherd and feeder of the flock of human beings.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_14" href="#Footnotev3_30_14"><span
          class="sp">14</span></a> But many other persons, besides the
      King, are concerned in feeding the human flock, and will therefore
      be included in this definition: which is thus proved to be too
      large, and to require farther qualification and restriction.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_15" href="#Footnotev3_30_15"><span
          class="sp">15</span></a> Moreover the feeding of the human
      flock belongs to others rather than to the King. He tends and
      takes care of the flock, but does not feed it: hence the
      definition is, in this way also, unsuitable.<a

      presidency of Kronus; and not such as he is in the present period.
      Under the presidency of Kronus, each human flock was tended and
      governed by a divine King or God, who managed every thing for it,
      keeping it happy and comfortable by his own unassisted agency: the
      entire Kosmos too, with its revolutions, was at that time under
      the immediate guidance of a divine mover. But in the present
      period this divine superintendance is withdrawn: both the entire
      Kosmos, and each separate portion of it, is left to its own
      movement, full of imperfection and irregularity. Each human flock
      is now tended not by a divine King, as it was then; but by a human
      King, much less perfect, less effective, less exalted above the
      constituent members. Now the definition which we fell upon (says
      Plato) suited the King of the Saturnian period; but does not suit
      the King of the present or human period.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_17"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> At the
      first commencement of the present period, the human flock, left to
      themselves without superintendance from the Gods, suffered great
      misery: but various presents from some Gods (fire from Prometheus,
      arts from Heph&aelig;stus and Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;, plants and seeds

        Plato, Politik. p. 274 C.</p>
      <p>
        Plato embodies these last-mentioned comparisons in an elaborate
        and remarkable mythe &#8212; theological, cosmical, zoological, social
        &#8212; which occupies six pages of the Politikus (268 D &#8212; 274 E).
        Meiners and Socher (Ueber Platon&#8217;s Schriften, pp. 273-275) point
        out that the theology of Plato in this fable differs much from
        what we read in the Ph&aelig;don, Republic, &amp;c.: and Socher
        insists upon such discrepancy as one of his arguments against
        the genuineness of the Politikus. I have already observed that I
        do not concur in his inference. I do not expect uniformity of
        doctrine in the various Platonic dialogues: more especially on a
        subject so much beyond experience, and so completely open to the
        conjectures of a rich imagination, as theology and cosmogony. In
        the Sophist&ecirc;s, pp. 242-243, Plato had talked in a sort of
        contemptuous tone about those who dealt with philosophical
        doctrine in the way of mythe, as a proceeding fit only for boys:
        (not unlike the manner of Aristotle, when he speaks of &#959;&#7985;
        &#956;&#965;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#8212; &#964;&#8048; &#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#7969;&#956;&#8118;&#962;, Metaphys. B. 1000, a. 15-18,
        &#x39B;. 1071, b. 27): while here, in the Politikus, he dilates upon
        what he admits to be a boyish mythe, partly because a certain
        portion of it may be made available in illustration of his
        philosophical purpose, partly because he wishes to enliven the
        monotony of a long-continued classification. Again, in the
        Ph&aelig;drus <span class="correction" title="omitted in text">(</span>p.
        229 C), the Platonic Sokrates is made to censure as futile any
        attempt to find rational explanations for the popular legends
        (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;): but here, in the Politikus, the Eleate expressly
        adapts his theory about the backward and forward rotation of the
        Kosmos to the explanation of the popular legends &#8212; about
        earthborn men, and about Helios turning back his chariot, in
        order to escape the shocking spectacle of the Thyestean banquet:
        which legends, when so explained, Plato declares that people
        would be wrong to disbelieve (&#959;&#7985; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8182;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#8182;&#962;
        &#7936;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;, pp. 271 B, 268 A, B, C).</p>
      <p>
        The differences of doctrine and handling, between the various
        Platonic dialogues, are facts not less worthy to be noted than
        the similarities. Here, in the mythe of the Politikus, we find a
        peculiar theological view, and a very remarkable cosmical
        doctrine &#8212; the rotation and counter-rotation of the Kosmos. The
        Kosmos is here declared (as in the Tim&aelig;us) to be a living
        and intelligent Subject; having received these mental gifts from
        its Demiurgus. But the Kosmos is also Body as well as Mind; so
        that it is incapable of that constant sameness or uniformity
        which belongs to the Divine: Body having in itself an incurable
        principle of disorder (p. 269 D). The Kosmos is perpetually in
        movement; but its movement is only rotatory or circular in the
        same place: which is the nearest approximation to uniformity of
        movement. It does not always revolve by itself; nor is it always
        made to revolve by the Divine Steersman (&#954;&#965;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#962;, p. 272 E),
        but alternately the one and the other. This Divine Steersman
        presides over its rotation for a certain time, and along with
        him many subordinate Deities or D&aelig;mons; until an epoch
        fixed by some unassigned destiny has been reached (p. 272 E).
        Then the Steersman withdraws from the process to his own
        watch-tower (&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#960;&#8052;&#957;), and the other Deities
        along with him. The Kosmos, being left to itself, ceases to
        revolve in the same direction, and begins its counter rotation;
        revolving by itself backwards, or in the contrary direction. By
        such violent revulsion many of the living inhabitants of the
        Kosmos are destroyed. The past phenomena are successively
        reproduced, but in an inverse direction &#8212; the old men go back to
        maturity, boyhood, infancy, death: the dead are born again, and
        pass through their lives backwards from age to infancy. Yet the
        counter-rotation brings about not simply an inverted
        reproduction of past phenomena, but new phenomena also: for we
        are told that the Kosmos, when left to itself, did tolerably
        well as long as it remembered the Steersman&#8217;s direction, but
        after a certain interval became forgetful and went wrong,
        generating mischief and evil: so that the Steersman was at last
        forced to put his hand again to the work, and to impart to it a
        fresh rotation in his own direction (p. 273 B-D). The Kosmos
        never goes satisfactorily, except when the hand of the Steersman
        is upon it. But we are informed that there are varieties of this
        divine administration: one named the period of Kronus or Saturn;
        another that of Zeus, &amp;c. The <i>present</i> is the period
        of Zeus (p. 272 B). The period of Kronus was one of spontaneous
        and universal abundance, under the immediate superintendence of
        the Deity. This Divine Ruler was infinitely superior to the
        subjects whom he ruled, and left nothing to be desired. But <i>now</i>,
        in the present period of Zeus, men are under human rule, and not
        divine: there is no such marked superiority of the Ruler to his
        subjects. The human race has been on the point of becoming
        extinct; and has only been saved by beneficent presents from
        various Gods &#8212; fire from Prometheus, handicraft from
        Heph&aelig;stus and Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; (pp. 272 C, 274 C).</p>
      <p>
        All this prodigious bulk of mythical invention (&#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#8004;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#962;,
        p. 277 B) seems to be introduced here for the purpose of
        illustrating the comparative ratio between the Ruler and his
        subjects; and the material difference in this respect between
        King and Shepherd &#8212; between the government of mankind by kings,
        and that of flocks and herds by the herdsman. In attempting to
        define the True and Genuine Ruler (he lays it down), we can
        expect nothing better than a man among other men; but
        distinguished above his fellows, so far as wisdom, dialectic,
        and artistic accomplishment, can confer superiority.</p>
      <p>
        There is much in this copious mythe which I cannot clearly
        understand or put together: nor do I derive much profit from the
        long exposition of it given by Stallbaum (Proleg. ad Polit. pp.
        100-128). We cannot fairly demand either harmonious consistency
        or profound meaning in the different features of an ingenious
        fiction. The hypothesis of a counter-rotation of the Kosmos
        (spinning like a top, &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#963;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#946;&#945;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#948;&#8056;&#962; &#7984;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953;, p. 270
        A), with an inverted reproduction of past phenomena, appears to
        me one of the most singular fancies in the Greek mythology. I
        cannot tell how far it may have been suggested by any such
        statement as that of the Egyptian priests (Herodot. ii. 142). I
        can only repeat the observation made by Ph&aelig;drus to the
        Platonic Sokrates, in the dialogue Ph&aelig;drus (p. 275 A):
        &#8220;You, Sokrates, construct easily enough Egyptian tales, or any
        other tales that you please&#8221;.</p>

      The human King, whom we shall now attempt to define, tends the
      human flock; but there are other persons also who assist in doing
      so, and without whose concurrent agency he could not attain his
      purpose. We may illustrate this by comparing with him the weaver
      of woollen garments: who requires many subsidiary and preparatory
      processes, performed by agents different from himself (such as the
      carder of wool, the spinner, and the manufacturer of the
      instruments for working the loom) to enable him to finish his
      work. In all matters, important as well as vulgar, two separate
      processes or arts, or contributory persons, are to be
      distinguished: Causes and Co-Causes, <i>i.e.</i>, Principal
      Causes, and Concurrent, Auxiliary, Co-efficient, Subordinate,
      Causes.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_19" href="#Footnotev3_30_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> The King, like the Weaver, is
      distinguishable, from other agents helping towards the same end,
      as a Principal Cause from Auxiliary Causes.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_20" href="#Footnotev3_30_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> The Causes auxiliary to the King, in
      so far as they are inanimate, may be distributed roughly under
      seven heads (bipartition being here <span class="pagenum"><a

        href="#Footnotev3_30_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Other
      auxiliary Causes are, the domestic cattle, bought slaves, and all
      descriptions of serving persons; being often freemen who
      undertake, for hire, servile occupations and low trades. There are
      moreover ministerial officers of a higher grade: heralds, scribes,
      interpreters, prophets, priests, Sophists, rhetors; and a great
      diversity of other functionaries, military, judicial, forensic,
      dramatic, &amp;c., who manage different departments of public
      affairs, often changing from one post to another.<a

      recognising the genuine King: whereas the truth is, that they are
      only ministerial and subordinate to him:&#8212; they are Concurrent
      Causes, while he is the only real or principal Cause.<a

        and crafty. This is not very intelligible, but I presume that it
        alludes to the variety of functions, and the frequent

        Unscientific.</span></p>
    <p>
      Our main object now (says the Eleate) is to distinguish this Real
      Cause from the subordinate Causes which are mistaken for its
      partners and equals:&#8212; the genuine and intelligent Governor, from
      those who pretend falsely to be governors, and are supposed often
      to be such.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_24" href="#Footnotev3_30_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> We cannot admit the lines of
      distinction, which are commonly drawn between different
      governments, as truly logical: at least they are only subordinate
      to ours. Most men distinguish the government of one, or a few, or
      the many: government of the poor or of the rich: government
      according to law, or without law:&#8212; by consent, or by force. The
      different names current, monarchy or despotism, aristocracy, or
      oligarchy, &amp;c., correspond to these definitions. But we hold
      that these definitions do not touch the true characteristic: which
      is to be found in Science, Knowledge, Intelligence, Art or
      scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page268" id="v3page268"></a>268</span>
      procedure, &amp;c., and in nothing else. The true government of
      mankind is, the scientific or artistic: whether it be carried on
      by one, or a few, or many &#8212; whether by poor or rich, by force or
      consent &#8212; whether according to law, or without law.<a

    <p>
      Looking to the characteristic here suggested, the Eleate
      pronounces that all numerous and popular governments must be

      man, or by a very small number at most. True science or art is not

    <p>
      How mischievous would it be (continues the Eleate) if we

      practise their respective arts: if we held them bound to
      peremptory rules, punishing them whenever they departed from those
      rules, and making them accountable before the Dikastery, when any
      one accused them of doing so: if we consecrated these rules and
      dogmas, forbidding all criticism or censure upon them, and putting
      to death the free enquirer as a dreaming, prosy, Sophist,
      corrupting the youth and inciting lawless discontent!<a

        governments. The one despot is the worse. Democracy is the least
        bad, because it is least of a government.</span></p>
    <p>
      We see therefore (the Eleate goes on) that there is no true polity
      &#8212; nothing which deserves the name of a genuine political society &#8212;
      except the government of one chief, scientific or artistic. With
      him laws are superfluous and even inconvenient. All other polities
      are counterfeits: factions and cabals, rather than governments:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_40" href="#Footnotev3_30_40"><span
          class="sp">40</span></a> delusions carried on by tricksters
      and conjurers. But among these other polities or sham polities,
      there is a material difference as to greater or less badness: and
      the difference turns upon the presence or absence of good laws.
      Thus, the single-headed government, called monarchy (assuming the
      Prince not to be a man of science or art) is the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page271" id="v3page271"></a>271</span>best
      of all the sham-polities, if the Prince rules along with and in
      observance of known good laws: but it is the worst of them all, if
      he rules without such laws, as a despot or tyrant. Oligarchy, or
      the government of a few &#8212; if under good laws, is less good than
      that of the Prince under the same circumstances &#8212; if without such
      laws, is less bad than that of the despot. Lastly, the government
      of the many is less good under the one supposition &#8212; and less bad
      under the other. It is less effective, either for good or for
      evil. It is in fact less of a government: the administrative force
      being lost by dissipation among many hands for short intervals;
      and more free play being thus left to individuals. Accordingly,
      assuming the absence of laws, democracy is the least bad or most
      tolerable of the six varieties of sham-polity. Assuming the
      presence of laws, it is the worst of them.<a

    <p>
      We have thus severed the genuine scientific Governor from the
      unworthy counterfeits by whom his agency is mimicked in actual
      society. But we have still to sever him from other worthier
      functionaries, analogous and cognate, with whom he co-operates;
      and to show by what characteristic he is distinguished from
      persons such as the General, the Judge, the Rhetor or Persuader to
      good and just objects. The distinction is, that all these
      functions, however honourable functions, are still nevertheless
      essentially subordinate and ministerial, assuming a sovereign
      guidance from some other quarter to direct them. Thus the General
      may, by his strategic art, carry on war effectively; but he must
      be directed when, and against whom, war is to be carried on. The
      Judge may decide quarrels without fear, antipathy, or favour: but
      the general rules for deciding them must be prescribed to him by a
      higher authority. So too the Rhetor may apply his art well, to
      persuade people, or to work upon their emotions, without teaching
      them: but he must be told by some one else, when and on what
      occasions persuasion is suitable, and when force must be employed
      instead of it.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_42" href="#Footnotev3_30_42"><span

      privilege and duty of the scientific chief, for which he alone is
      competent. He does not act himself, but he originates, directs,

        do. He will aim at the formation of virtuous citizens. He will
        weave together the energetic virtues with the gentle virtues.
        Natural dissidence between them.</span></p>
    <p>
      The great scientific Governor being thus defined, and logically
      distinguished from all others liable to be confounded with him,
      Plato concludes by a brief statement what his principal functions
      are. He will aim at ensuring among his citizens the most virtuous
      characters and the best ethical combinations. Like the weaver (to
      whom he has been already assimilated) he will put together the
      great political web or tissue of improved citizenship,
      intertwining the strong and energetic virtues (the warp) with the
      yielding and gentler virtues (the woof).<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_44"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> Both
      these dispositions are parts or branches of virtue; but there is a
      natural variance or repulsion between them.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_45" href="#Footnotev3_30_45"><span
          class="sp">45</span></a> Each of them is good, in proper
      measure and season: each of them is bad, out of measure and
      season. The combination of both, in due proportion, is
      indispensable to form the virtuous citizen: and that combination
      it is the business of the scientific Governor to form and uphold.
      It is with a view to this end that he must set at work all the
      agents of teaching and education, and must even interfere to
      arrange the intermarriages of the citizens; not allowing the
      strong and courageous families to form alliance with each other,
      lest the breed should in time become too violent &#8212; nor the gentle
      and quiet families to do the like, lest the offspring should
      degenerate into stupidity.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_46"

          id="Sidenotev3_30_17"></a>Remarks &#8212; Sokratic Ideal &#8212; Title to
        govern mankind derived exclusively from scientific superiority
        in an individual person.</span></p>
    <p>
      I have thus given a brief abridgment of the main purpose of the
      Politikus, and of the definition which Plato gives of the True
      Governor and his function. I proceed to make a few remarks upon
      it.</p>
    <p>
      Plato&#8217;s theory of government is founded upon the supposition of
      perfect knowledge &#8212; scientific or artistic intelligence &#8212; in the
      person of the Governor: a partial approach, through teaching and
      acquired knowledge, to that immense superiority of the Governor
      over the Governed, which existed in the Saturnian period. It is
      this, and this alone, which constitutes, in his estimation, the
      title to govern mankind. The Governor does not himself act: he
      directs the agency of others: and the directions are dictated by
      his knowledge. I have already observed that Sokrates had himself
      enunciated the doctrine &#8212; Superior scientific competence (the
      special privilege of a professor or an artist) is the only
      legitimate title to govern.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_30_18"
          id="Sidenotev3_30_18"></a>Different ways in which this ideal
        is worked out by Plato and Xenophon. The man of speculation and
        the man of action.</span></p>
    <p>
      From Sokrates the idea passed both to Plato and to Xenophon: and
      the contrast between the two is shown forcibly by the different
      way in which they deal with it. Xenophon has worked it out on a
      large <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page274" id="v3page274"></a>274</span>scale,
      in the Cyrop&aelig;dia &#8212; on a small scale, in the &#338;conomicus.
      Cyrus in the former, Ischomachus in the latter, knows better than
      any one else what is to be done, and gives orders accordingly. But
      both the one and the other are also foremost in action, setting
      example as well as giving orders to others. Now Plato, while
      developing the same idea, draws a marked line of distinction
      between Science and Practice:&#8212; between direction and execution.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_50" href="#Footnotev3_30_50"><span
          class="sp">50</span></a> His scientific Governor does not act
      at all, but he gives orders to all the different men of action,
      and he is the only person who knows on what occasions and within
      what limits each agent should put forth his own special aptitude.
      Herein we discern one of the distinctions between these two <i>viri
        Socratici</i>: Xenophon, the soldier and man of action &#8212; Plato,
      the speculative philosopher. Xenophon conceives the conditions of
      the True Governor in a larger way than Plato, for he includes
      among them the forward and energetic qualities requisite for
      acting on the feelings of the subject Many, and for disposing them
      to follow orders with cheerfulness and zeal:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_51" href="#Footnotev3_30_51"><span
          class="sp">51</span></a> whereas Plato makes abstraction of
      this part of the conditions, and postulates obedience on the part
      of the many as an item in his fundamental hypothesis. Indeed he
      perpetually presents us with the comparison of the physician, who
      cuts and burns for the purpose of ultimate cure. Plato either
      neglects, or assumes as a matter of course, the sentiments of the
      persons commanded, or the conditions of willing obedience; while
      Xenophon dwells upon the maintenance of such sentiments as one of
      the capital difficulties in the problem of government. And we
      perceive a marked contrast between the unskilful proceedings of
      Plato, when he visited Dionysius II. at Syracuse, illustrating his
      (Plato&#8217;s) inaptitude for dealing with a real situation &#8212; and the
      judicious management of Xenophon, when acting as one of the
      leaders of the Cyreian army under circumstances alike unexpected
      and perilous. </p>

        contradiction to that theory which is assigned to Protagoras in

    <p>
      Plato here sets forth the business of governing as a special art,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page275" id="v3page275"></a>275</span>analogous
      to the special art of the weaver, the steersman, the physician.
      Now in each special art, the requisite knowledge and competence is
      possessed only by the one or few artists who practise them. The
      knowledge possessed by such one or few, suffices for all the
      remaining community; who benefit by it, but are altogether
      ignorant on the matter, and follow orders blindfold. As this one
      Artist is the only competent person for the task, so he is assumed
      <i>qu&acirc;</i> Artist, to be infallible in the performance of
      the task &#8212; never to go wrong, nor to abuse his power, nor to aim
      at any collateral end.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_52"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> Such is
      Plato&#8217;s theory of government in the Politikus. But if we turn to
      the Protagoras, we shall find this very theory of government
      explicitly denied, and a counter-theory affirmed, in the discourse
      put into the mouth of Protagoras. That Sophist is made to
      distinguish the political or social art, upon which the
      possibility of constituting or keeping up human society depends,
      from all other arts (manual, useful, linguistic), by this express
      characteristic: All other arts were distributed among mankind in
      such manner, that knowledge and skill were confined to an
      exclusive few, whose knowledge, each in his own special
      department, sufficed for the service of all the rest, not favoured
      with the like knowledge &#8212; but the political or social art was
      distributed (by order of Zeus to Hermes) on a principle quite
      opposite. It was imparted to every member of society without
      exception. If it had been granted only to a few, and not to all,
      society could not have held together. Justice and the sense of
      shame (Temperance or Moderation), which are the bonds of the city
      and the fruits of the political art, must be instilled into every
      man. Whoever cannot take on and appropriate them (Zeus proclaims
      it as his law), must be slain as a nuisance or distemper of the
      city.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_53" href="#Footnotev3_30_53"><span

        rests upon common sentiment.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such we have seen to be the theory enunciated by the Platonic
      Protagoras (in the dialogue so-called) respecting the political or
      social art. It pervades all the members of society, as a common
      and universal attribute, though each man has his own specialty
      besides. It was thus distributed at the outset by Zeus. It stands
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page276" id="v3page276"></a>276</span>embodied
      in the laws and in the unwritten customs, so that one man may know
      it as well as another. Every man makes open profession of knowing
      and possessing it:&#8212; which he cannot do with any special art.
      Fathers enforce it on their children by rewards and punishments,
      schoolmasters and musicians impart it by extracts from the poets:
      the old teach it to the young: nay every man, far from desiring to
      monopolise it for himself, is forward in teaching it to others:
      for it is the interest of every one that his neighbour should
      learn it. Since every one thus teaches it, there are no professed
      or special teachers: yet there are still some few who can teach it
      a little better than others &#8212; and among those few I (says
      Protagoras) am one.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_54"

          class="sp">56</span></a> to which I have just referred, will
      see that they stand to each other as theory and counter-theory.
      The theory in the Politikus sets aside (intentionally or not) that
      in the Protagoras. The Platonic Protagoras, spokesman of King
      Nomos, represents common sense, sentiment, sympathies and
      antipathies, written laws, and traditional customs known to all as
      well as reverenced by the majority: the Platonic Politikus
      repudiates all these, as preposterous fetters to the single
      Governor who monopolises all political science and art. Let us add
      too, that the Platonic Protagoras (whom many commentators teach us
      to regard as a person of exorbitant arrogance and pretensions) is
      a very modest man compared to the Eleate in the Platonic
      Politikus. For the former accepts all the written laws and
      respected customs around him, &#8212; admits that most others know them,
      in the main, as well as he, &#8212; and only professes to have acquired
      a certain amount of superior skill in impressing them upon others:
      whereas the latter sets them all aside, claims for himself an
      uncontradicted monopoly of social science and art, and postulates
      an extent of blind submission from society such as has never yet
      been yielded in history.</p>

        as elsewhere. Plato complains of the assumption of infallibility
        in existing societies, but exacts it severely in that which he
        himself constructs.</span></p>
    <p>
      The reproach implied in these phrases of Plato is doubtless
      intended as an allusion to the condemnation of Sokrates. It is a
      reproach well-founded against that proceeding of the government of
      Athens:&#8212; and would have been still better founded against other
      contemporary governments. That the Athenians were intolerant, is
      not to be denied: but they were less intolerant than any of their
      contemporaries. Nowhere else except at Athens could Sokrates have
      gone on until seventy years of age talking freely in the
      market-place against the received political and religious
      orthodoxy. There was more free speech (&#960;&#945;&#8164;&#8165;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945;)<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_58" href="#Footnotev3_30_58"><span
          class="sp">58</span></a> at Athens than in any part of the
      contemporary world. Plato, Xenophon, and the other companions of
      Sokrates, proclaimed by lectures and writings that they thought
      themselves wiser than the laws of Athens: yet though the Gorgias
      was intended as well as adapted to bring into hatred and contempt
      both those laws and the persons who administered them, the
      Athenian Rhetors never indicted Plato for libel. Upon this point,
      we can <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page278" id="v3page278"></a>278</span>only
      speak comparatively: for perfect liberty of proclaiming opinions
      neither does now exist, nor ever has existed, any where. Most men
      have no genuine respect for the right of another to form and
      express an opinion dissentient from theirs: if they happen to hate
      the opinion, they account it a virtue to employ as much ill-usage
      or menace as will frighten the holder thereof into silence. Plato
      here points out in emphatic language,<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_59"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> the
      deplorable consequences of assuming infallibility and perfection
      for the legal and customary orthodoxy of the country, and
      prohibiting free censure by dissentient individuals. But this is
      on the supposition that the laws and customs are founded only on
      common sense and traditional reverence:&#8212; and that the scientific
      Governor is among the dissenters. Plato&#8217;s judgment is radically
      different when he supposes the case reversed:&#8212; when King Nomos is
      superseded by the scientific Professor of whom Plato dreams, or by
      a lawgiver who represents him. We shall observe this when we come
      to the Treatise de Legibus, in which Plato constitutes an
      orthodoxy of his own, prohibiting free dissent by restrictions and
      penalties stricter than any which were known to antiquity. He
      cannot recognise an infallible common sense: but he has no scruple
      in postulating an infallible scientific dictator, and in
      enthroning himself as such. Though well aware that reasoned truth
      presents itself to different philosophers in different versions,
      he does not hesitate to condemn those philosophers who differ from
      him, to silence or to something worse.</p>

        distinguished three gradations of polity. Gigantic individual
        force the worst.</span></p>
    <p>
      It will appear then that the Platonic Politikus distinguishes
      three varieties and gradations of social constitution.</p>
    <p>
      1. <i>Science or Art. Systematic Construction from the beginning,
        based upon Theory.</i> &#8212; That which is directed by the constant
      supervision of a scientific or artistic Ruler. This is the only
      true or legitimate polity. Represented by Plato in Republic.
      Illustrated by the systematic scheme of weights, measures,
      apportionment of years, months, and days, in calendar &#8212; put
      together on scientific principles by the French Convention in 1793
      &#8212; as contrasted with the various local, incoherent, growths, which
      had obtained recognition through custom or arbitrary preference of
      unscientific superiors.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page279" id="v3page279"></a>279</span>2.
      <i>Common Sense. Unsystematic Aggregate of Customs, accepted in an
        Actual Society.</i> &#8212; That which is directed by written laws and
      fixed traditional customs, known to every one, approved by the
      common sense of the community, and communicated as well as upheld
      by the spontaneous teaching of the majority. King Nomos.</p>
    <p>
      This stands for the second best scheme: the least objectionable
      form of degeneracy &#8212; yet still a degeneracy. It is the scheme set
      forth by the Platonic Protagoras, in the dialogue so called.
      Represented with improvements by Plato in Treatise De Legibus.</p>
    <p>
      3. <i>Gigantic Individual Force.</i> &#8212; That in which some violent
      individual &#8212; not being really scientific or artistic, but perhaps
      falsely pretending to be so &#8212; violates and tramples under foot the
      established laws and customs, under the stimulus of his own
      exorbitant ambition and unmeasured desires.</p>
    <p>
      This is put forward as the worst scheme of all: as the greatest
      depravation of society, and the greatest forfeiture of public as
      well as private happiness. We have here the proposition which
      P&ocirc;lus and Kallikl&ecirc;s are introduced as defending in the
      Gorgias, and Thrasymachus in the Republic. In both dialogues,
      Sokrates undertakes to expose it. The great benefit conferred by
      King Nomos, is, that he protects society against the maximum of
      evil.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_30_25"
          id="Sidenotev3_30_25"></a>Comparison of the Politikus with the
        Republic. Points of analogy and difference.</span></p>
    <p>
      Another interesting comparison may be made: that between the
      Politikus and the Republic. We must remember that the Politikus is
      announced by Plato as having two purposes. 1. To give a lesson in
      the method of definition and division. 2. To define the
      characteristic of the person bearing the name of Politikus,
      distinguishing him from all others, analogous or disparate. &#8212; The
      method is here more prominent than the doctrine.</p>
    <p>
      But in the Republic, no lesson of method is attempted; the
      doctrine stands alone and independent of it. We shall find however
      that the doctrine is essentially the same. That which the
      Politikus lays down in brief outline, is in the Republic amplified
      and enlarged; presented with many variations and under different
      points of view, yet, still at the bottom, the same doctrine, both
      as to affirmation and negation. The Republic affirms (as the
      Politikus does) the exclusive legitimacy of science, art,
      intelligence, &amp;c., as the initiatory and omnipotent authority
      over all <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page280" id="v3page280"></a>280</span>the
      constituent members of society: and farther, that such
      intelligence can have no place except in one or a few privileged
      persons. The Republic (like the Politikus) presents to us the
      march of society with its Principal Cause &#8212; its concurrent or
      Auxiliary Causes &#8212; and its inferior governable mass or matter, the
      human flock, indispensable and co-essential as a part of the whole
      scheme. In the Republic, the Cause is represented by the small
      council of philosophical Elders: the concurrent causes, by the
      Guardians or trained soldiers: the inferior matter, by the
      remaining society, which is distributed among various trades,
      providing for the subsistence and wants of all. The explanation of
      Justice (which is the ostensible purpose of the Republic) is made
      to consist in the fact &#8212; That each one of these several parts does
      its own special work &#8212; nothing more &#8212; nothing less. Throughout all
      the Republic, a constant parallelism is carried on (often indeed
      overstrained) between the community and the individual man. In the
      one as well as in the other, Plato recognises the three
      constituent elements, all essential as co-operators, but each with
      its own special function: in the individual, he recognises three
      souls (encephalic, thoracic, and abdominal) as corresponding to
      Elders, Guardians, and Producers, in the community. Here are the
      same features as those given in outline in the Politikus: but the
      two higher features of the three appear greatly expanded in the
      Republic: the training and conditions proper for the philosophic
      Artist or Governor, and for his auxiliaries the Guardians, being
      described and vindicated at great length. Moreover, in the
      Republic, Plato not only repeats the doctrine<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_60" href="#Footnotev3_30_60"><span
          class="sp">60</span></a> that the right of command belongs to
      every art in its own province and over its own subject-matter
      (which is the cardinal point in the Politikus) &#8212; but he farther
      proclaims that each individual neither can exercise, nor ought to
      exercise, more than one art. He allows no double men or triple men<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_61" href="#Footnotev3_30_61"><span
          class="sp">61</span></a> &#8212; &#8220;Quam quisque novit artem, in
      e&acirc; se exerceat&#8221;. He would not have respected the Xenophontic
      Cyrus or Ischomachus. He carries the principle of specialization
      to its extreme point. His Republic <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page281" id="v3page281"></a>281</span>is an aggregate
      of special artists and professional aptitudes: among whom the
      Governor is only one, though the first and rarest. He sets aside
      the common basis of social endowments essential to every man: upon
      which each man&#8217;s specialty is superinduced in the theory of the
      Platonic Protagoras. The only common quality which Plato admits
      is, &#8212; That each man, and each of the three souls composing each
      man, shall do his own business and his own business only: this is
      his definition of Justice, in the Republic.<a

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_30_26"
          id="Sidenotev3_30_26"></a>Comparison of the Politikus with the
        Kratylus. Dictatorial, constructive, science or art, common to
        both: applied in the former to social administration &#8212; in the
        latter to the formation and modification of names.</span></p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I will illustrate the Politikus by comparison with the
      Kratylus, which will be treated in the <a href="#Platovol3ch31">next
        chapter</a>. The conception of dictatorial science or art, which
      I have stated as the principal point in the Politikus, appears
      again in the Kratylus applied to a different subject &#8212; naming, or
      the imposition of names. Right and legitimate name-giving is
      declared to be an affair of science or art, like right and
      legitimate polity: it can only be performed by the competent
      scientific or artistic name-giver, or by the lawgiver considered
      in that special capacity. The second title of the dialogue
      Kratylus is &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8008;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8008;&#961;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8212; On the Rectitude or
      legitimacy of names. What constitutes right and legitimate
      Name-giving? In like manner, we might provide a second title for
      the Politikus &#8212; &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#928;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#8008;&#961;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8212; On the rectitude or
      legitimacy of polity or sociality. What constitutes right or
      legitimate sociality?<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_63"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> Plato
      answers &#8212; It is the constant dictation and supervision of art or
      science &#8212; or of the scientific, artistic, dictator, who alone
      knows both the End and the means. This alone is right and true
      sociality &#8212; or sociality as it ought to be. So, if we read the
      Kratylus, we find Plato defining in the same way right Name-giving
      &#8212; or name-giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page282"
          id="v3page282"></a>282</span> as it ought to be. It is when
      each name is given by an artistic name-constructor, who discerns
      the Form of the name naturally suitable in each particular case,
      and can embody it in appropriate letters and syllables.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_30_64" href="#Footnotev3_30_64"><span
          class="sp">64</span></a> A true or right name signifies by
      likeness to the thing signified.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_65"
        href="#Footnotev3_30_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> The good
      lawgiver discerns this likeness: but all lawgivers are not good:
      the bad lawgiver fancies that he discerns it, but is often
      mistaken.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_66" href="#Footnotev3_30_66"><span
          class="sp">66</span></a> It would be the ideal perfection of
      language, if every name could be made to signify by likeness to
      the thing named. But this cannot be realised: sufficient
      likenesses cannot be found to furnish an adequate stock of names.
      In the absence of such best standard, we are driven to eke out
      language by appealing to a <i>second-best</i>, an inferior and
      vulgar principle approximating more or less, to rectitude &#8212; that
      is, custom and convention.<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_67"

        Plato sometimes speaks as if a bad &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945; were no &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945; at

      We see thus that in the Kratylus also, as well as in the
      Politikus, the systematic dictation of the Man of Science or Art
      is pronounced to be the only basis of complete rectitude. Below
      this, and far short of it, yet still indispensable as a supplement
      in real life &#8212; is, the authority of unsystematic custom or
      convention; not emanating from any systematic constructive Artist,
      but actually established (often, no one knows how) among the
      community, and resting upon their common sentiment, memory, and
      tradition.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_30_27"

        in the Politikus. No notice taken of the doubts and difficulties
        raised in Lach&ecirc;s and Charmid&ecirc;s.</span></p>
    <p>
      This is the true Platonic point of view, considering human affairs
      in every department, the highest as well as the lowest, as
      subjects of Art and Science: specialization of attributes and
      subdivision of function, so that the business of governing falls
      to the lot of one or a few highly qualified Governors: while the
      social edifice is assumed to have been constructed from the
      beginning by one of these Governors, with a view to consistent,
      systematic, predetermined ends &#8212; instead of that incoherent
      aggregate<a name="FnAnchorv3_30_68" href="#Footnotev3_30_68"><span
          class="sp">68</span></a> which is consecrated under the empire
      of law <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page283" id="v3page283"></a>283</span>and
      custom. Here in the Politikus, we read that the great purpose of
      the philosophical Governor is to train all the citizens into
      virtuous characters: by a proper combination of Courage and
      Temperance, two endowments naturally discordant, yet each alike
      essential in its proper season and measure. The interweaving of
      these two forms the true Regal Web of social life.<a

        insignificant function, for the political Artist determined and
        installed by so elaborate a method and classification. But the
        dialogue was already so long that Plato could not well lengthen
        it by going into fuller details. Socher points out (Ueber
        Platon&#8217;s Schrift. p. 274) discrepancies between the Politikus on
        one side, and Protagoras and Gorgias on the other &#8212; which I
        think are really discoverable, though I do not admit the
        inference which he draws from them.</p>

      Such is the concluding declaration of the accomplished Eleatic
      expositor, to Sokrates and the other auditors. But this suggests
      to us another question, when we revert to some of the Platonic
      dialogues handled in the preceding pages. What <i>are</i> Virtue,
      Courage, Temperance? In the Menon, the Platonic Sokrates had
      proclaimed, that he did not himself know what virtue was: that he
      had never seen any one else who did know: that it was impossible
      to say how virtue could be communicated, until you knew what
      virtue was &#8212; and impossible to determine any one of the parts of
      virtue, until virtue had been determined as a whole. In the
      Charmid&ecirc;s, Sokrates had affirmed that he did not know what
      Temperance was; he then tested several explanations thereof,
      propounded by Charmides and Kritias: but ending only in universal
      puzzle and confessed ignorance. In the Lach&ecirc;s, he had done
      the same with Courage: not without various expressions of regret
      for his own ignorance, and of surprise at those who talked freely
      about generalities which they had never probed to the bottom.
      Perplexed by these doubts and difficulties &#8212; which perplexed yet
      more all his previous hearers, the modest beauty of <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page284" id="v3page284"></a>284</span>Charmides
      and the mature dignity of Nikias and Laches &#8212; Sokrates now finds
      himself in presence of the Eleate, who talks about Virtue,
      Temperance, Courage, &amp;c., as matters determinate and familiar.
      Here then would have been the opportunity for Sokrates to
      reproduce all his unsolved perplexities, and to get them cleared
      up by the divine Stranger who is travelling on a mission of
      philosophy. The third dialogue, to be called the Philosophus,
      which Plato promises as sequel to the Sophist&ecirc;s and
      Politikus, would have been well employed in such a work of
      elucidation. </p>

        Plato&#8217;s Dialogues of Search &#8212; To stimulate the intellect of the
        hearer. His exposition does not give solutions.</span></p>
    <p>
      This, I say, is what we might have expected, if Plato had
      corresponded to the picture drawn by admiring commentators: if he
      had merely tied knots in one dialogue, in order to untie them in
      another. But we find nothing of the kind, nor is such a picture of
      Plato correct. The dialogue Philosophus does not exist, and
      probably was never written. Respecting the embarrassments of the
      Menon, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Alkibiad&ecirc;s I.,
      Protagoras, Euthyphron &#8212; Sokrates says not a word &#8212; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#947;&#961;&#973; &#8212; to
      urge them upon the attention of the Eleate: who even alludes with
      displeasure to contentious disputants as unfair enemies. For the
      right understanding of these mysterious but familiar words &#8212;
      Virtue, Courage, Temperance &#8212; we are thrown back upon the common
      passive, unscientific, unreasoning, consciousness: or upon such
      measure and variety of it as each of us may have chanced to imbibe
      from the local atmosphere, unassisted by any special revelation
      from philosophy. At any rate, the Eleate furnishes no
      interpretative aid. He employs the words, as if the hearers
      understood them of course, without the slightest intimation that
      any difficulty attaches to them. Plato himself ignores all the
      difficulties, when he is putting positive exposition into the
      mouth of the Eleate. Puzzles and perplexities belong to the
      Dialogues of Search; in which they serve their purpose, if they
      provoke the intellect of the hearer to active meditation and
      effort, for the purpose of obtaining a solution.</p>

    <h2>
      KRATYLUS.</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>The dialogue entitled Kratylus presents numerous difficulties to
      the commentators: who differ greatly in their manner of
      explaining, First, What is its main or leading purpose? Next, How
      much of it is intended as serious reasoning, how much as mere
      caricature or parody, for the purpose of exposing and reducing to
      absurdity the doctrines of opponents? Lastly, who, if any, are the
      opponents thus intended to be ridiculed?</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_1"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_1"></a>Persons and subjects of the dialogue
        Kratylus &#8212; Sokrates has no formed opinion, but is only a
        Searcher with the others.</span></p>
    <p>
      The subject proposed for discussion is, the rectitude or inherent
      propriety of names. How far is there any natural adaptation, or
      special fitness, of each name to the thing named? Two disputants
      are introduced who invoke Sokrates as umpire. Hermogenes asserts
      the negative of the question; contending that each name is
      destitute of natural significance, and acquires its meaning only
      from the mutual agreement and habitual usage of society.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_1" href="#Footnotev3_31_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
      Kratylus on the contrary maintains the doctrine that each name has
      a natural rectitude <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page286"
          id="v3page286"></a>286</span>or fitness for its own
      significant function:&#8212; that there is an inherent bond of
      connection, a fundamental analogy or resemblance between each name
      and the thing signified. Sokrates carries on the first part of the
      dialogue with Hermogenes, the last part with Kratylus.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_2" href="#Footnotev3_31_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
      He declares more than once, that the subject is one on which he is
      ignorant, and has formed no conclusion: he professes only to
      prosecute the search for a good conclusion, conjointly with his
      two companions.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_3" href="#Footnotev3_31_3"><span
          class="sp">3</span></a></p>

        In the arguments put into the mouth of Hermogenes, he is made to
        maintain two opinions which are not identical, but opposed. 1.
        That names are significant by habit and convention, and not by
        nature. 2. That each man may and can give any name which he
        pleases to any object (pp. 384-385). </p>
      <p>
        The first of these two opinions is that which is really
        discussed here: impugned in the first half of the dialogue,
        conceded in the second. It is implied that names are to serve
        the purpose of mutual communication and information among
        persons living in society; which purpose they would not serve if
        each individual gave a different name to the same object. The
        second opinion is therefore not a consequence of the first, but
        an implied contradiction of the first.</p>
      <p>
        He who says that the names Horse and Dog are significant by
        convention, will admit that at the outset they might have been
        inverted in point of signification; but he will not say that any
        individual may invert them at pleasure, now that they are
        established. The purposes of naming would no longer be answered,
        if this were done.</p>

        The question between Hermogenes and Kratylus was much debated
        among the philosophers and literary men throughout antiquity
        (Aul. Gell. x. 4). Origen says (contra Celsum, i. c. 24) &#8212; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;
        &#946;&#945;&#952;&#8058;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#8164;&#8165;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, &#8033;&#962; &#959;&#7988;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;
        &#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#962;, &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8048; &#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, &#7970;, &#8033;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
        &#931;&#964;&#959;&#8118;&#962;, &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;.</p>
      <p>
        Aristotle assumes the question in favour of &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;, in his
        treatise De Interpretatione, without any reasoning, against the
        Platonic Kratylus; but his commentators, Ammonius and Boethius,
        note the controversy as one upon which eminent men in antiquity
        were much divided.</p>
      <p>
        Plato connects his opinion, that names have a natural rectitude
        of signification, with his general doctrine of self-existent,
        archetypal, Forms or Ideas. The Stoics, and others who defended
        the same opinion afterwards, seem to have disconnected it from
        this latter doctrine.</p>

    <p>
      Sokrates, refuting Hermogenes, lays down the following doctrines.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_4" href="#Footnotev3_31_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
      If propositions are either true or false, names, which are parts
      of propositions, must be true or false also.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_5" href="#Footnotev3_31_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
      Every thing has its own fixed and determinate essence, not
      relative to us nor varying according to our fancy or pleasure, but
      existing <i>per se</i> as nature has arranged.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_6" href="#Footnotev3_31_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
      All agencies either by one thing upon other things, or by other
      things upon it, are in like manner determined by nature,
      independent of our will and choice. If we intend to cut or burn
      any substance, we must go to work, not according to our <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page287" id="v3page287"></a>287</span>own
      pleasure, but in the manner that nature prescribes: by attempting
      to do it contrary to nature, we shall do it badly or fail
      altogether.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_7" href="#Footnotev3_31_7"><span
          class="sp">7</span></a> Now <i>speaking</i> is one of these
      agencies, and <i>naming</i> is a branch of <i>speaking</i>: what
      is true of other agencies is true of these also &#8212; we must name
      things, not according to our own will and pleasure, but in the way
      that nature prescribes that they shall be named.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_8" href="#Footnotev3_31_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
      Farther, each agency must be performed by its appropriate
      instrument: cutting by the axe, boring by the gimlet, weaving by
      the bodkin. The name is the instrument of naming, whereby we
      communicate information and distinguish things from each other. It
      is a didactic instrument: to be employed well, it must be in the
      hands of a properly qualified person for the purpose of teaching.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_9" href="#Footnotev3_31_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
      Not every man, but only the professional craftsman, is competent
      to fabricate the instruments of cutting and weaving. In like
      manner, not every man is competent to make a name: no one is
      competent except the lawgiver or the gifted name-maker, the rarest
      of all existing artists.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_10"

      <p>
        This is the same doctrine which Plato puts into the mouth of
        Hermogenes (Kratylus, p. 384 E), and which Sokrates himself, in
        the latter half of the dialogue, admits as true to a large
        extent: that is, he admits that names are significant &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;
        &#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951;&#957;, though he does not deny that they are or may be
        significant &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;.</p>
      <p>
        &#932;&#8056; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; (p. 397 A) is another phrase for expressing
        the opinion opposed to &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;.</p>

      <p>
        Here too, Aristotle affirms the contrary: he says (with far more
        exactness than Plato) that propositions alone are true or false;
        and that a name taken by itself is neither. (De Interpret. i.
        2.)</p>
      <p>
        The mistake of Plato in affirming Names to be true or false, is
        analogous to that which we read in the Phil&ecirc;bus, where
        Pleasures are distinguished as true and false.</p>

        Speaking and naming are regarded by Plato as acts whereby the
        thing (spoken of or) named is acted upon or suffers. So in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s (p. 248) he considers Knowing as an act
        performed, whereby the thing known suffers. Deuschle (Die
        Platonische Sprach-philosophie, p. 59, Marpurg. 1859) treats
        this comparison made by Plato between naming and material
        agencies, as if it were mere banter &#8212; and even indifferent
        banter. Schleiermacher in his note thinks it seriously meant and
        Platonic; and I fully agree with him (Schl. p. 456).</p>

    <p>
      To what does the lawgiver look when he frames a name? Compare the
      analogy of other instruments. The artisan who constructs a bodkin
      or shuttle for weaving, has present to his mind as a model, the
      Idea or Form of the bodkin &#8212; the self-existent bodkin of Nature
      herself. If a broken shuttle is to be replaced, it is this Idea or
      type, not the actual broken instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page288" id="v3page288"></a>288</span> which he seeks
      to copy. Whatever may be the variety of web for which the shuttle
      is destined, he modifies the new instrument accordingly: but all
      of them must embody the Form or Idea of the shuttle. He cannot
      choose another type according to his own pleasure: he must embody
      the type, prescribed by nature, in the iron, wood, or other
      material of which the instrument is made.<a

      So about names: the lawgiver, in distributing names, must look to
      the Idea, Form, or type &#8212; the self-existent name of Nature &#8212; and
      must embody this type, as it stands for each different thing, in
      appropriate syllables. The syllables indeed may admit of great
      variety, just as the material of which the shuttle is made may be
      diversified: but each aggregate of syllables, whether Hellenic or
      barbaric, must embody the essential Name-Idea or Type.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_12" href="#Footnotev3_31_12"><span

      classify all the sorts of things on the one hand, and all the
      varieties of letters or elements of language on the other;
      distinguishing the special significative power belonging to each
      letter. He ought then to construct his words, and adapt each to
      signify that with which it is naturally connected. Who is to judge
      whether this process has been well or ill performed? Upon that
      point, the judge is, the professional man who uses the instrument.
      It is for the working weaver to decide whether the shuttle given
      to him is well or ill made. To have a good ship and rudder, it
      must be made by a professional builder, and appreciated by a
      professional pilot or steersman. In like manner, the names
      constructed by the lawgiver must be appreciated by the man who is
      qualified by training or study to use names skilfully: that is, by
      the dialectician or philosopher, competent to ask and answer
      questions.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_14" href="#Footnotev3_31_14"><span

    <p>
      Such is the theory here laid down by Sokrates respecting Names. It
      is curious as illustrating the Platonic vein of speculation. It
      enlarges to an extreme point Plato&#8217;s region of the absolute and
      objective. Not merely each thing named, but each name also, is in
      his view an Ens absolutum; not dependent upon human choice &#8212; not
      even relative (so he alleges) to human apprehension. Each name has
      its own self-existent Idea, Form, or Type, the reproduction or
      copy of which is imperative. The Platonic intelligible world
      included Ideas of things, and of names correlative to them: just
      as it included Ideas of master and slave correlative to each
      other. It contained Noumena of names, as well as Noumena of
      things.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_16" href="#Footnotev3_31_16"><span

      <p>
        The story given by Herodotus (ii. 2) about the experiment made
        by the Egyptian king Psammetichus, is curious. He wished to find
        out whether the Egyptians or the Phrygians were the oldest or
        first of mankind: he accordingly caused two children to be
        brought up without having a word spoken to them, with a view to
        ascertain what language they would come to by nature. At the age
        of two years they uttered the Phrygian word signifying <i>bread</i>.
        Psammetichus was then satisfied that the Phrygians were the
        first of mankind.</p>
      <p>
        This story undoubtedly proceeds upon the assumption that there
        is one name which naturally suggests itself for each object. But
        when M. Renan says that the assumption is the same &#8220;as Plato has
        developed with so much subtlety in the Kratylus,&#8221; I do not agree
        with him. The Absolute Name-Form or Essence, discernible only by
        the technical Lawgiver, is something very different. See M.
        Renan, De l&#8217;Origine du Langage, ch. vi. p. 146, 2nd ed.</p>

      Another point here is peculiar to Plato. The Name-Giver must
      provide names such as can be used with effect by the dialectician
      or philosopher: who is the sole competent judge whether the names
      have genuine rectitude or not.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_19"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> We see
      from hence that the aspirations of Plato went towards a
      philosophical language fit for those who conversed with forms or
      essences: something like (to use modern illustrations) a technical
      nomenclature systematically constructed for the expositions of men
      of science: such as that of Chemistry, Botany, Mineralogy, &amp;c.
      Assuredly no language actually spoken among men, has ever been
      found suitable for this purpose without much artificial help.<a

    <p>
      As this theory of naming is a deduction from Plato&#8217;s main doctrine
      of absolute or self-existing Ideas, so it also illustrates (to
      repeat what was said in the last <a href="#Sidenotev3_30_26">chapter</a>)
      his recognition of professional skill and of competence vested
      exclusively in a gifted One or Few: which he ranks as the sole
      producing cause of Good or the Best, setting it in contrast with
      those two causes which he considers as productive of Evil, or at
      any rate of the Inferior or Second-Best: 1. The One or Few, who
      are ungifted and unphilosophical: perhaps ambitious pretenders. 2.
      The spontaneous, unbespoken inspirations, conventions, customs, or
      habits, which grow up without formal mandate among the community.
      To find the right name of each thing, is no light matter, nor
      within the competence of any one or many ordinary men. It can only
      be done by one of the few privileged lawgivers. Plato even glances

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_7"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_7"></a>Counter-Theory, which Sokrates here
        sets forth and impugns &#8212; the Protagorean doctrine &#8212; Homo
        Mensura.</span> </p>
    <p>
      In laying down the basis of his theory respecting names, Plato
      states another doctrine as opposed to it: <i>viz.</i>, the
      Protagorean doctrine &#8212; Man is the Measure of all things. I have
      already said something about this doctrine, in reviewing the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, where Plato impugns it: but as he here
      impugns it again, by arguments in part different &#8212; a few words
      more will not be misplaced.</p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of Protagoras maintains that all things are relative
      to the percipient, cogitant, concipient, mind: that all Object is
      implicated with a Subject: that as things appear to me, so they
      are to me &#8212; as they appear to you, so they are to you. Plato
      denies this, and says: &#8220;All things have a fixed essence of their
      own, absolutely and in themselves, not relative to any percipient
      or cogitant &#8212; nor dependent upon any one&#8217;s appreciative
      understanding, or emotional susceptibility, or will. Things are so
      and so, without reference to us as sentient or cogitant beings:
      and not only the things are thus independent and absolute, but all
      their agencies are so likewise &#8212; agencies either by them or upon
      them. Cutting, burning, speaking, naming, &amp;c., must be
      performed in a certain determinate way, whether we prefer it or
      not. A certain Name belongs, by Nature or absolutely, to a certain
      thing, whether we choose it or not: it is not relative to any
      adoption by us, either individually or collectively.&#8221;</p>
    <p>
      This Protagorean theory is here set forth by the Platonic Sokrates
      as the antithesis or counter-theory, to that which he is himself
      advancing, <i>viz.</i> &#8212; That Names are significant by nature and
      not by agreement of men:&#8212; That each Nomen is tied to its Nominatum
      by a natural and indissoluble bond. His remarks imply, that those
      who do not accept this last-mentioned theory must agree with
      Protagoras. But such an antithesis is noway necessary: since (not
      to speak of Hermogenes himself in this very dialogue) we find also
      that Aristotle &#8212; who maintains that Names are significant by
      convention and not by nature &#8212; dissents<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page292" id="v3page292"></a>292</span> also from the
      theory of Protagoras: and would have rested his dissent from it on
      very different grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_8"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_8"></a>Objection by Sokrates &#8212; That
        Protagoras puts all men on a level as to wisdom and folly,
        knowledge and ignorance.</span></p>
    <p>
      This will show us &#8212; what I have already remarked in commenting on
      the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; that Plato has not been very careful
      in appreciating the real bearing of the Protagorean doctrine. He
      impugns it here by the same argument which we also read in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus. &#8220;Everyone admits&#8221; (he says) &#8220;that there are
      some men wise and good &#8212; others foolish and wicked. Now if you
      admit this, you disallow the Protagorean doctrine. If I contend
      that as things appear to me, so they truly are to me &#8212; as things
      appear to you or to him, so they truly are to you or to him &#8212; I
      cannot consistently allow that any one man is wiser than any
      other. Upon such a theory, all men are put upon the same level of
      knowledge or ignorance.&#8221;</p>
    <p>
      But the premisses of Plato here do not sustain his inference.</p>

        Protagorean theory really affirms &#8212; Belief always relative to
        the believer&#8217;s mind.</span></p>
    <p>The Protagorean doctrine is, when stated in its most general
      terms, &#8212; That every man is and must be his own measure of truth or
      falsehood &#8212; That what appears to him true, <i>is true to him</i>,
      however it may appear to others &#8212; That he cannot by any effort
      step out of or beyond his own individual belief conviction,
      knowledge &#8212; That all his Cognita, Credita, Percepta, Cogitata,
      &amp;c., imply himself as Cognoscens, Credens, Percipiens,
      Cogitans, inseparably and indivisibly &#8212; That in affirming an
      object, he himself is necessarily present as affirming subject,
      and that Object and Subject are only two sides of the same
      indivisible fact<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_22"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> &#8212; That
      though there are some <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page293"

      believing, there is no criterion at once infallible and
      universally recognised, in matters where they dissent: moreover,
      the matters believed are just as much relative where all agree, as
      where some disagree.</p>

    <p>
      This doctrine is not refuted by the fact, that every man believes
      others to be wiser than himself on various points. A man is just
      as much a measure to himself when he acts upon the advice of
      others, or believes a fact upon the affirmation of others, as when
      he judges upon his own unassisted sense or reasoning. He is a
      measure to himself when he agrees with others, as much as when he
      disagrees with them. Opinions of others, or facts attested by
      others, may count as materials determining his judgment; but the
      judgment is and must be his own. The larger portion of every man&#8217;s
      knowledge rests upon the testimony of others; nevertheless the
      facts thus reported become portions of <i>his</i> knowledge,
      generating conclusions <i>in him</i> and relatively <i>to him</i>.
      I believe the narrative of travellers, respecting parts of the
      globe which I have never seen: I adopt the opinion of A a lawyer,
      and of B a physician, on matters which I have not studied: I
      understand facts which I did not witness, from the description of
      those who did witness them. In all these cases the act of adoption
      is my own, and the grounds of belief are relative to my state of
      mind. Another man may mistrust completely the authorities which I
      follow: just as I mistrust the authority of Mahomet or Confucius,
      or various others, regarded as infallible by a large portion of
      mankind. The grounds of belief are to a certain extent similar, to
      a certain extent dissimilar, in different men&#8217;s minds. Authority
      is doubtless a frequent ground of belief; but it is essentially
      variable and essentially relative to the believer. Plato himself,
      in many passages, insists emphatically upon the dissensions in
      mankind respecting the question &#8212; &#8220;<i>Who are</i> the good and
      wise men?&#8221; He tells us that the true philosopher is accounted by
      the bulk of mankind foolish and worthless.</p>

        (cutting and burning) appealed to by Sokrates &#8212; does not sustain

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page294" id="v3page294"></a>294</span>In
      the Kratylus, Sokrates says (and I agree with him) that there are
      laws of nature respecting the processes of cutting and burning:
      and that any one who attempts to cut or burn in a way
      unconformable to those laws, will fail in his purpose. This is
      true, but it proves nothing against Protagoras. It is an appeal to
      a generalization from physical facts, resting upon experience and
      induction &#8212; upon sensation and inference which we and others,
      Protagoras as well as Plato, have had, and which we believe to be
      common to all. We know this fact, or have a full and certain
      conviction of it; but we are not brought at all nearer to the
      Absolute (<i>i.e.</i>, to the Object without Subject) which Plato&#8217;s
      argument requires. The analogy rather carries us away from the
      Absolute: for cutting and burning, with their antecedent
      conditions, are facts of sense: and Plato himself admits, to a
      great extent, that the facts of sense are relative. All experience
      and induction, and all belief founded thereupon, are essentially
      relative. The experience may be one common to all mankind, and
      upon which all are unanimous:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_23"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> but it
      is not the less relative to each individual<span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page295" id="v3page295"></a>295</span> of the
      multitude. What is relative to all, continues to be relative to
      each: the fact that all sentient individuals are in this respect
      alike, does not make it cease to be relative, and become absolute.
      What I see and hear in the theatre is relative to me, though it
      may at the same time be relative to ten thousand other spectators,
      who are experiencing like sensations. Where all men think or
      believe alike, it may not be necessary for common purposes to
      distinguish the multiplicity of individual thinking subjects: yet
      the subjects are nevertheless multiple, and the belief, knowledge,
      or fact, is relative to each of them, whether all agree, or
      whether beliefs are many and divergent. We cannot suppress
      ourselves as sentient or cogitant subjects, nor find any <i>locus
        standi</i> for Object pure and simple, apart from the ground of
      relativity. And the Protagorean dictum brings to view these
      subjective conditions, as being essential, no less than the
      objective, to belief and disbelief.</p>

        Plato had assimilated naming to cutting and burning. Aristotle
        denies the analogy: he says that cutting and burning are the
        same to all, or <i>are by nature</i>: naming is not the same to
        all, and is therefore not by nature.</p>
      <p>
        We find here the test pointed out to distinguish what <i>is by
          nature</i> (that which Plato calls the &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#946;&#941;&#946;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

        or among all. What it is to one individual, it is to another
        also. There are a multitude of different judging subjects, but
        no dissentient subjects: myself, and in my belief all other
        subjects, are affected alike. This is the true and real
        Objective: a particular fact of sense, where Subject is not
        eliminated altogether, but becomes a constant quantity, and
        therefore escapes separate notice. An Objective <i>absolute</i>
        (<i>i.e.</i>, without Subject altogether) is an impossibility.</p>
      <p>
        In the Aristotelian sense of &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;, it would be correct to say
        that Language, or Naming <i>in genere</i>, is natural to man.
        No human society has yet been found without some language &#8212; some
        names &#8212; some speech employed and understood by each individual
        member. But many different varieties of speech will serve the
        purpose, not indeed with equal perfection, yet tolerably: enough
        to enable a society to get on. The uniformity (&#964;&#8056; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;) here
        ceases. To a certain extent, the objects and agencies which are
        named, are the same in all societies: to a certain extent
        different. If we were acquainted with all the past facts
        respecting the different languages which have existed or do
        exist on the globe, we should be able to assign the reason which
        brought each particular <i>Nomen</i> into association with its
        <i>Nominatum</i>. But this past history is lost.</p>

      Protagoras would have agreed with Plato as to combustion &#8212; that
      there were certain antecedent conditions under which he fully
      expected it, and certain other conditions under which he expected
      with confidence that it would not occur. Only he would have
      declared this (assuming him to speak conformably to his own
      theory) to be his own full belief and conviction, derived from
      certain facts and comparisons of sense, which he also <i>knew</i>
      to be shared by most other persons. He would have pronounced
      farther, that those who held opposite opinions were in his
      judgment wrong: but he would have recognised that their opinion
      was true to themselves, and that their belief must be relative to
      causes operating upon <i>their</i> minds. Farthermore, he would
      have pointed out, that combustion itself, with its antecedents,
      were facts of sense, relative to individual sentients and
      observers, remembering and comparing what they had observed. This
      would have been the testimony of Protagoras (always assuming him
      to speak in conformity with his own theory), but it would not have
      satisfied Plato: who would have required a peremptory, absolute
      affirmation, discarding all relation to observers or observed
      facts, and leaving no scope for error or fallibility.</p>

    <p>Those who agree with Plato on this question, impugn the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page296" id="v3page296"></a>296</span>doctrine
      of Protagoras as effacing all real, intrinsic, distinction between
      truth and falsehood. Such objectors make it a charge against
      Protagoras, that he does not erect his own mind into a peremptory
      and infallible measure for all other minds.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_24" href="#Footnotev3_31_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> He expressly recognises the
      distinction, so far as his own mind is concerned: he admits that
      other men recognise it also, each for himself. Nevertheless, to
      say that all men recognise one and the same objective distinction
      between truth and falsehood, would be to contradict palpable
      facts. Each man has a standard, an ideal of truth in his own mind:
      but different men have different standards. The grounds of belief,
      though in part similar with all men, are to a great extent
      dissimilar also: they are dissimilar even with the same man, at
      different periods of his life and circumstances. What all men have
      in common is the feeling of belief and the feeling of disbelief:
      the matters believed or disbelieved, as well as the ideal standard
      to which any new matter presented for belief or disbelief is
      referred, differ considerably. By rational discussion &#8212; by facts
      and reasonings set forth on both sides, as in the Platonic
      dialogues &#8212; opinions may be overthrown or modified: dissentients
      may be brought into agreement, or at least each may be rendered
      more fully master of the case on both sides. But this dialectic,
      the Platonic question and answer, is itself an appeal to the free
      action of the individual mind. The questioner starts from
      premisses conceded by the respondent. He depends upon the
      acquiescence of the respondent for every step taken in advance.
      Such a proceeding is relative, not absolute: coinciding with the
      Protagorean formula rather than with the Platonic negation of it.<a

    <p>
      The grounds of belief, according to Protagoras, relative to the
      individual, are not the same with all men at all times. But it
      does not follow (nor does Protagoras appear to have asserted) that
      they vary according to the <i>will</i> or <i>inclination</i> of
      the individual. Plato, in impugning this doctrine, reasons as if
      these two things were one and the same &#8212; as if, according to
      Protagoras, a man believed whatever he chose.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_26" href="#Footnotev3_31_26"><span
          class="sp">26</span></a> This, however, is not an exact
      representation of the doctrine &#8220;Homo Mensura&#8221;: which does not
      assert the voluntary or the arbitrary, but simply the relative as
      against the absolute. What a man believes does not depend upon his
      own will or choice: it depends upon an aggregate of circumstances,
      partly peculiar to himself, partly common to him with other
      persons more or fewer in number:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_27"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> upon his

      These and other ingredients &#8212; analogous, yet neither the same nor
      combined in the same manner, even in different individuals of the
      same time and country, much less in those of different times and
      countries &#8212; compose the aggregate determining grounds of belief or
      disbelief in every one. Each man has in his mind an ideal standard
      of truth and falsehood: but that ideal standard, never exactly the
      same in any two men, nor in the same man at all times, often
      varies in different men to a prodigious extent. Now it is to this
      standard in the man&#8217;s own mind that those reasoners refer who
      maintain that belief is relative. They do not maintain, that it is
      relative simply to his wishes, or that he believes and disbelieves
      what he chooses.</p>

        The error here noted is enumerated by by Mr. John Stuart Mill,
        among the specimens of Fallacies of Confusion, in his System of
        Logic, Book v. ch. vii. &sect; 1: &#8220;The following is an argument
        of Descartes to prove, in his <i>&agrave; priori</i> manner,
        the being of a God. The conception, says he, of an infinite
        Being proves the real existence of such a Being. For if there is
        not really any such Being, <i>I</i> must have made the
        conception: but if I could make it, I can also unmake it &#8212; which
        evidently is not true: therefore there must be, externally to
        myself, an archetype from which the conception was derived. In
        this argument (which, it may be observed, would equally prove
        the real existence of ghosts and of witches) the ambiguity is in
        the pronoun <i>I</i>; by which, in one place, is to be
        understood <i>my will</i> &#8212; in another, the <i>laws of my
          nature</i>. If the conception, existing as it does in my mind,
        had no original without, the conclusion would unquestionably
        follow that <i>I</i> made it &#8212; that is, the laws of my nature
        must have somehow evolved it: but that <i>my will</i> made it,
        would not follow. Now when Descartes afterwards adds that I
        cannot unmake the conception, he means that I cannot get rid of
        it by an act of my will &#8212; which is true, but is not the
        proposition required. I can as much unmake this conception as I
        can any other: no conception which I have once had, can I ever
        dismiss by mere volition: but what some of the laws of my nature
        have produced, other laws, or those same laws in other
        circumstances, may, and often do, subsequently efface.&#8221;</p>

        To show how constantly this Protagorean dictum is misconceived,
        as if Protagoras had said that things were to each individual
        what he was pleased or chose to represent them as being, I
        transcribe the following passage from Lassalle&#8217;s elaborate work
        on Herakleitus (vol. ii. p. 381):&#8212; &#8220;Des Protagoras Prinzip ist
        es, dass &uuml;berhaupt Nichts Objektives ist; dass vielmehr
        alles Beliebige was Einem scheint, auch f&uuml;r ihn sei. Dies
        Selbstsetzen des Subjekts ist die einzige Wahrheit der Dinge,
        welche an sich selbst Nichts Objektives haben, sondern zur
        gleichg&uuml;ltigen Fl&auml;che geworden sind, auf die das
        Subjekt willk&uuml;hrlich und beliebig seine Charaktere
        schreibt.&#8221;</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Protagoras does not (as is here asserted) deny the Objective:
        he only insists on looking at it in conjunction with, or
        measured by, some Subject; and that Subject, not simply as
        desiring or preferring, but clothed in all its attributes.</p>

    <p>
      When Plato says that combustibility and secability of objects are
      properties fixed and determinate,<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_28"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> this is
      perfectly true, as meaning that a certain proportion of the facts
      of sense affect in the same way the sentient and appreciative
      powers of each individual, determining the like belief in every
      man who has ever experienced them. Measuring and weighing are
      sensible facts of this character: seen alike by all, and
      conclusive proofs to all. But this implies, to a certain point,
      fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page299"
          id="v3page299"></a>299</span> uniformity in the individual
      sentients and judges. Where such condition is wanting &#8212; where
      there is a fundamental difference in the sensible apprehension
      manifested by different individuals &#8212; the unanimity is wanting
      also. Such is the case in regard to colours and other sensations:
      witness the peculiar vision of Dalton and many others. The
      unanimity in the first case, the discrepancy in the second, is
      alike an aggregate of judgments, each individual, distinct, and
      relative. You pronounce an opponent to be in error: but if you
      cannot support your opinion by evidence or authority which
      satisfies <i>his</i> senses or <i>his</i> reason, he remains
      unconvinced. Your individual opinion stands good <i>to you</i>;
      his opinion stands good <i>to him</i>. You think that he ought to
      believe as you do, and in certain cases you feel persuaded that he
      will be brought to that result by future experience, which of
      course must be relative to him and to his appreciative powers. He
      entertains the like persuasion in regard to you.</p>

        When Plato asserts not only that Objects are absolute and not
        relative to any Subject &#8212; but that the agencies or properties of
        Objects are also absolute &#8212; he carries the doctrine farther than
        modern defenders of the absolute. M. Cousin, in the eighth and
        ninth Lectures of his Cours d&#8217;Hist. de la Philosophie Morale au
        18<span class="sp">me</span> Si&egrave;cle, lays down the
        contrary, maintaining that objects and essences alone are
        absolute, though unknowable; but that their agencies are
        relative and knowable.</p>

        &#8220;Nous savons qu&#8217;il exists quelque chose hors de nous, parceque
        nous ne pouvons expliquer nos perceptions sans les rattacher
        &agrave; des causes distinctes de nous m&ecirc;mes: nous savons
        de plus que ces causes, dont nous ne connaissons pas d&#8217;ailleurs
        l&#8217;essence, <i>produisent les effets les plus variables, les
          plus divers, et m&ecirc;me les plus contraires, selon qu&#8217;elles
          rencontrent telle nature ou telle disposition du sujet.</i>
        Mais savons-nous quelque chose de plus? et m&ecirc;me, vu le
        caract&egrave;re ind&eacute;termin&eacute; des causes que nous
        concevons dans les corps, y-a-t-il quelque chose de plus
        &agrave; savoir? Y-a-t-il lieu de nous enqu&eacute;rir si nous
        percevons <i>les choses telles qu&#8217;elles sont? Non,
          &eacute;videmment.&#8230; Je ne dis pas que le probl&egrave;me est
          insoluble: je dis qu&#8217;il est absurde, et renferme une
          contradiction.</i> Nous ne savons pas ce que ces causes sont
        en elles-m&ecirc;mes, et la raison nous d&eacute;fend de
        chercher &agrave; les conna&icirc;tre: mais il est bien
        &eacute;vident <i>&agrave; priori</i> qu&#8217;elles ne sont pas en
        elles-m&ecirc;mes ce qu&#8217;elles sont par rapport &agrave; nous, <i>puisque
          la pr&eacute;sence du sujet modifie n&eacute;cessairement leur
          action</i>. Supprimez tout sujet sentant, il est certain que
        ces causes agiraient encore, puisqu&#8217;elles continueraient
        d&#8217;exister: mais elles agiraient autrement; elles seraient encore
        des qualit&eacute;s et des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s, mais qui ne
        ressembleraient &agrave; rien de ce que nous connaissons. Le feu
        ne manifesterait plus aucune des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s que
        nous lui connaissons: que serait-il? C&#8217;est ce que nous ne
        saurons jamais. C&#8217;est d&#8217;ailleurs peut-&ecirc;tre un
        probl&egrave;me qui ne r&eacute;pugne pas seulement &agrave; la
        nature de notre esprit mais &agrave; l&#8217;essence m&ecirc;me des
        choses. Quand m&ecirc;me en effet on supprimerait par la
        pens&eacute;e tous les sujets sentants, il faudrait encore
        admettre que nul corps ne manifesterait ses

        quelconque, et dans ce cas <i>ses propri&eacute;t&eacute;s ne

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_16"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_16"></a>Sokrates exemplifies his theory of
        the Absolute Name or the Name-Form. He attempts to show the
        inherent rectitude of many existing names. His etymological
        transitions.</span> </p>
    <p>
      It is thus that Sokrates, in the first half of the Kratylus, lays
      down his general theory that names have a natural and inherent
      propriety: and that naming is a process which cannot be performed
      except in one way. He at the same time announces that his theory
      rests upon a principle opposed to the &#8220;Homo Mensura&#8221; of
      Protagoras. He then proceeds to illustrate his doctrine by
      exemplification of many particular names, which are alleged to
      manifest a propriety of signification in reference to the persons
      or matters to which they are applied. Many of these are proper
      names, but some are common names or appellatives. Plato regards
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page300" id="v3page300"></a>300</span>proper
      names as illustrating, even better than the common, the doctrine
      of inherent rectitude in naming: especially the names of the Gods,
      with respect to the use of which Plato was himself timidly
      scrupulous &#8212; and the names reported by Homer as employed by the
      Gods themselves. We must remember that nearly all Grecian proper
      names had some meaning: being compounds or derivatives from
      appellative nouns.</p>
    <p>
      The proper names are mostly names of Gods or Heroes: then follow
      the names of the celestial bodies (conceived as Gods), of the
      elements, of virtues and vices, &amp;c. All of them, however, both
      the proper and the common names, are declared to be compound, or
      derivative; presupposing other simple and primitive names from
      which they are formed.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_29"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> Sokrates
      declares the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page301"
          id="v3page301"></a>301</span>fundamental theory on which the
      primitive roots rest; and indicates the transforming processes,
      whereby many of the names are deduced or combined from their
      roots. But these processes, though sometimes reasonable enough,
      are in a far greater number of instances forced, arbitrary, and
      fanciful. The transitions of meaning imagined, and the structural
      transformations of words, are alike strange and violent.<a

        Thus Proklus observes:&#8212; &#8220;The recklessness about proper names, is
        shown in the case of the man who gave to his son the name of
        Athanasius&#8221; (Proklus, Schol. ad Kratyl. p. 5, ed. Boiss.)
        Proklus adopts the distinction between divine and human names,
        citing the authority of Plato in Kratylus. The words of Proklus
        are remarkable, ad Tim&aelig;um, ii. p. 197. Schneid. &#927;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#947;&#940;&#961;

        When Plato (Kratylus, pp. 391-392; compare Ph&aelig;drus, p. 252
        A) cites the lines of Homer mentioning appellations bestowed by
        the Gods, I do not understand him, as Gr&auml;fenhahn and others
        do, to speak in mockery, but <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>. The
        affirmation of Clemens Alexandrinus (Stromat. i. 104) gives a
        probable account of Plato&#8217;s belief:&#8212; &#8009; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8150;&#962;

        When we read the views of some learned modern philologists, such
        as Godfrey Hermann, we cannot be surprised that many Greeks in

      Such is the light in which these Platonic etymologies appear to a
      modern critic. But such was not the light in which they appeared
      either to the ancient Platonists, or to critics earlier than the
      last century. The Platonists even thought them full of mysterious
      and recondite wisdom. Dionysius of Halikarnassus highly commends
      Plato for his speculations on etymology, especially in the
      Kratylus.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_31" href="#Footnotev3_31_31"><span
          class="sp">31</span></a> Plutarch cites some of the most
      singular etymologies in the Kratylus as serious and instructive.
      The modesty of the Protagorean formula becomes here especially
      applicable: for so complete has been the revolution of opinion,
      that the Platonic etymologies are <i>now</i> treated by <i>most</i>
      critics as too absurd to have been seriously intended by Plato,
      even as conjectures. It is called <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page303" id="v3page303"></a>303</span>&#8220;a valuable
      discovery of modern times&#8221; (so Schleiermacher<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_32" href="#Footnotev3_31_32"><span
          class="sp">32</span></a> terms it) that Plato meant all or
      most of them as mere parody <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page304" id="v3page304"></a>304</span>and caricature.
      We are now told that it was not Plato who misconceived the
      analogies, conditions, and limits, of etymological transition, but
      others; whom Plato has here set himself to expose and ridicule, by
      mock etymologies intended to parody those which they had proposed
      as serious. If we ask who the persons thus ridiculed were, we
      learn that they were the Sophists, Protagoras, or Prodikus, with
      others; according to Schleiermacher, Antisthenes among them.<a

      <p>
        About Plato&#8217;s etymologies, as seriously intended, see Plutarch,
        De Iside et Osiride, p. 375 C-D-E, with the note of Wyttenbach.
        Harris, in his Hermes (pp. 369-370-407), alludes to the
        etymologies of Plato in the Kratylus as being ingenious, though
        disputable, but not at all as being derisory caricatures. Indeed
        the etymology of <i>Scientia</i>, which he cites from Scaliger,
        p. 370, is quite as singular as any in the Kratylus. Sydenham
        (Notes to the translation of Plato&#8217;s Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 35)
        calls the Kratylus &#8220;a dialogue, in which is taught the nature of
        things, as well the permanent as the transient, from a supposed
        etymology of names and words.</p>
      <p>
        I find, in the very instructive comments of Bishop Colenso on
        the Pentateuch (Part iv. ch. 24, p. 250), a citation from St.
        Augustine, illustrating the view which I believe Plato to have
        taken of these etymologies: &#8220;Quo loco prorsus non arbitror
        pr&aelig;tereundum, quod pater Valerius animadvertit admirans,
        in quorundam rusticanorum (<i>i.e.</i>, Africans, near Carthage)
        collocutione. Cum enim alter alteri dixisset <i>Salus</i> &#8212;
        qu&aelig;sivit ab eo, qui et Latin&eacute; nosset et
        Punic&eacute;, quid esset <i>Salus</i>: responsum est, <i>Tria</i>.
        Tum ille agnoscens cum gaudio, salutem nostram esse Trinitatem,
        convenientiam linguarum non fortuitu sic sonuisse arbitratus
        est, sed occultissim&acirc; dispensatione divin&aelig;
        providenti&aelig; &#8212; ut cum Latin&eacute; nominatur <i>Salus</i>,
        &agrave; Punicis intelligantur <i>Tria</i> &#8212; et cum Punici
        lingu&acirc; su&acirc; <i>Tria</i> nominant, Latin&eacute;
        intelligatur <i>Salus</i> &#8230; Sed <i>h&aelig;c verborum
          consonantia</i>, sive provenerit sive provisa sit, <i>non
          pugnaciter agendum est ut ei quisque consentiat, sed quantum
          interpretantis elegantiam hilaritas audientis admittit.</i>&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        So in the etymologies of the Kratylus: Plato follows out threads
        of analogy, which, with indulgent hearers, he reckons will be
        sufficient for proof: and which, even when not accepted as
        proof, will be pleasing to the fancy of unbelieving hearers, as
        they are to his own. There is no intention to caricature: no
        obvious absurdities piled up with a view to caricature.</p>

        Stallbaum, Prolegg. ad Platon. Cratylum, p. 4, says: &#8220;Quod mirum
        est non esse ab iis animadversum, qui Platonem putaverunt de
        lingu&aelig; et vocabulorum origine hoc libro suam sententiam
        explicare voluisse. Isti enim adeo nihil senserunt irrisionis,
        ut omnia atque singula pro philosophi decretis venditarint,
        ideoque ei absurdissima qu&aelig;que commenta affinxerint. Ita
        Menagius.&#8230; Nec Tiedemannus Argum, Dial. Plat. multo rectius
        judicat. Irrisionem primi senserunt Garnierius et Tennemann.&#8221;
        &amp;c. Stallbaum, moreover, is perpetually complaining in his
        notes, that the Etymological Lexicons adopt Plato&#8217;s derivations
        as genuine. M&eacute;nage (ad Diogen. Laert. iii. 25) declares
        most of the etymologies of Plato in the Kratylus to be
        &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#941;&#964;&#965;&#956;&#945;, but never hints at the supposition that they are
        intended as caricatures. During the centuries between Plato and
        M&eacute;nage, men had become more critical on the subject of
        etymology: in the century after M&eacute;nage, they had become
        more critical still, as we may see by the remarks of Turgot on
        the etymologies of M&eacute;nage himself.</p>
      <p>
        The following are the remarks of Turgot, in the article
        &#8216;Etymologie&#8217; (Encycl. Franc. in Turgot&#8217;s collected works, vol.
        iii. p. 33): &#8220;M&eacute;nage est un exemple frappant des
        absurdit&eacute;s dans lesquelles on tombe, en adoptant sans
        choix ce que sugg&egrave;re la malheureuse facilit&eacute; de
        supposer tout ce qui est possible: car il est tr&egrave;s vrai
        qu&#8217;il ne fait aucune supposition dont la possibilit&eacute; ne
        soit justifi&eacute;e par des exemples. Mais nous avons
        prouv&eacute; qu&#8217;en multipliant &agrave; volont&eacute; les
        alt&eacute;rations interm&eacute;diaires, soit dans le son, soit
        dans la signification, il est ais&eacute; de d&eacute;river un
        mot quelconque de tout autre mot donn&eacute;: c&#8217;est le moyen <i>d&#8217;expliquer
          tout, et d&egrave;s-lors de ne rien expliquer</i>; c&#8217;est le
        moyen aussi de justifier tous les m&eacute;pris de l&#8217;ignorance.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Steinhart (Einleitung zum Kratylus, pp. 551-552) agrees with
        Stallbaum to a certain extent, that Plato in the Kratylus
        intended to mock and caricature the bad etymologists of his own
        day; yet also that parts of the Kratylus are seriously intended.
        And he declares it almost impossible to draw a line between the
        serious matter and the caricature.</p>
      <p>
        It appears to me that the Platonic critics here exculpate Plato
        from the charge of being a bad etymologist, only by fastening
        upon him another intellectual defect quite as serious.</p>
      <p>
        Dittrich, in his Dissertation De Cratylo Platonis, Leipsic,
        1841, adopts the opinion of Schleiermacher and the other
        critics, that the etymological examples given in this dialogue,
        though Sokrates announces them as proving and illustrating his
        own theory seriously laid down, are really bitter jests and
        mockery, intended to destroy it &#8212; &#8220;hanc sententiam facetissimis
        et irrisione plenis exemplis, dum comprobare videtur,
        rever&acirc; infringit&#8221; (p. 12). Dittrich admits that Kratylus,
        who holds the theory derided, understands nothing of this <i>acerbissima
          irrisio</i> (p. 18). He thinks that Protagoras, not Prodikus
        nor Antisthenes, is the person principally caricatured (pp.
        32-34-38).</p>

        Lobeck (Aglaophamus, p. 866) says that the Pythagoreans were

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_18"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_18"></a>Dissent from this theory &#8212; No proof
        that the Sophists ever proposed etymologies.</span></p>
    <p>
      To me this modern discovery or hypothesis appears inadmissible. It
      rests upon assumptions at best gratuitous, and in part incorrect:
      it introduces difficulties greater than those which it removes. We
      find no proof that the Sophists ever proposed such etymologies as
      those which are here supposed to be ridiculed &#8212; or that they
      devoted themselves to etymology at all. If they etymologised, they
      would doubtless do so in the manner (to our judgment loose and
      fantastic) of their own time and of times long after them. But
      what ground have we for presuming that Plato&#8217;s views on the
      subject were more correct? and that etymologies which to them
      appeared admissible, would be regarded by him as absurd and
      ridiculous?</p>
    <p>
      Now if the persons concerned were other than the Sophists,
      scarcely any critic would have thought himself entitled to fasten
      upon them a discreditable imputation without some evidence. Of
      Prodikus we know (and that too chiefly from some sarcasms of
      Plato) that he took pains to distinguish words apparently, but not
      really, equivalent: and that such accurate distinction was what he
      meant by &#8220;rectitude of names&#8221; (Plato, Euthyd&ecirc;m. 277 E.) Of
      Protagoras we know that he taught, by precept or example, correct
      speaking or writing: but we have no information that either of
      them pursued etymological researches, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page305" id="v3page305"></a>305</span>successfully or
      unsuccessfully.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_34" href="#Footnotev3_31_34"><span
          class="sp">34</span></a> Moreover this very dialogue
      (Kratylus) contains strong presumptive evidence that the Platonic
      etymologies could never have been intended to ridicule Protagoras.
      For these etymologies are announced by Sokrates as exemplifying
      and illustrating a theory of his own respecting names: which
      theory (Sokrates himself expressly tells us) is founded upon the
      direct negation of the cardinal doctrine of Protagoras.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_35" href="#Footnotev3_31_35"><span
          class="sp">35</span></a> That Sophist, therefore, could not
      have been ridiculed by any applications, however extravagant, of a

      <p>
        Stallbaum says, Proleg. ad Krat. p. 11:&#8212; &#8220;Quibus verbis <i>haud
          dubi&eacute;</i> notantur Sophist&aelig;; qui, neglectis

        quin ista omnia ad mentem sophistarum maximeque Protagoreorum <i>joculari
          imitatione</i> explicata sint&#8221;.</p>
      <p>
        In spite of these confident assertions, &#8212; first, that the
        Sophists are the persons <i>intended</i> to be ridiculed, next,
        that they <i>deserved</i> to be so ridiculed &#8212; Stallbaum has
        another passage, p. 15, wherein he says, &#8220;Jam vero quinam
        fuerint philosophi isti atque etymologi, qui in Cratylo ridentur
        et exploduntur, <i>vulgo parum exploratum habetur</i>&#8221;. He goes
        on to say that neither Prodikus nor Antisthenes is meant, but
        Protagoras and the Protagoreans. To prove this he infers, from a
        passage in this dialogue (c. 11, p. 391 C), that Protagoras had
        written a book &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; (Heindorf and
        Schleiermacher, with better reason, infer from the passage
        nothing more than the circumstance that Protagoras taught
        &#8000;&#961;&#952;&#959;&#949;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#957; or correct speaking and writing). The passage does
        not prove this; but if it did, what did Protagoras teach in the
        book? Stallbaum tells us (p. 16):&#8212; &#8220;Jam si qu&aelig;ras, quid
        tandem Protagoras ipse de nominum ortu censuerit, <i>fateor
          un&acirc; conjectur&acirc; nitendum esse, ut de h&acirc;c re
          aliquid eruatur</i>&#8221;. He then proceeds to <i>conjecture</i>,
        from the little which we know respecting Protagoras, what that
        Sophist must have laid down upon the origin of names; and he
        finishes by assuming the very point which he ought to have
        proved (p. 17):&#8212; &#8220;<i>ex ipso Cratylo intelligimus et cognoscimus</i>,
        mox inter Protagor&aelig; amicos exstitisse qui inept&eacute;
        h&aelig;c studia persequentes, non e verbis et nominibus mentis
        human&aelig; notiones elicere et illustrare, sed in verba et
        nomina sua ipsi decreta transferre et sic ea probare et
        confirmare niterentur. Quid quidem homines &agrave; Platone hoc
        libro <i>facetissim&acirc; irrisione</i> exagitantur,&#8221; &amp;c.
        I repeat, that in spite of Stallbaum&#8217;s confident assertions, he
        fails in giving the smallest proof that Protagoras or the
        Sophists proposed etymologies such as to make them a suitable
        butt for Plato on this occasion. Ast also talks with equal
        confidence and equal absence of proof about the silly and
        arbitrary etymological proceedings of the Sophists, which (he
        says) this dialogue is intended throughout to ridicule (Ast,
        Platon&#8217;s Leben und Schriften, pp. 253-254-264, &amp;c.).</p>

        Lassalle (Herakleitos, vol. ii. pp. 379-384) asserts and shows
        very truly that Protagoras cannot be the person intended to be
        represented by Plato under the name of Kratylus, or as holding
        the opinion of Kratylus about names. Lassalle affirms that Plato
        intends Kratylus in the dialogue to represent Herakleitus
        himself (p. 385); moreover he greatly extols the sagacity of
        Herakleitos for having laid down the principle, that &#8220;Names are
        the essence of things,&#8221; in which principle Lassalle (so far as I
        understand him) himself concurs.</p>
      <p>
        Assuming this to be the case, we should naturally suppose that
        if Plato intends to ridicule any one, by presenting caricatured
        etymologies as flowing from this principle, the person intended
        as butt must be Herakleitus himself. Not so Lassalle. He asserts
        as broadly as Stallbaum that it was Protagoras and the other
        Sophists who grossly abused the doctrine of Herakleitus, for the
        purpose of confusing and perverting truth by arbitrary
        etymologies. His language is even more monstrous and extravagant
        than that of Stallbaum; yet he does not produce (any more than
        Stallbaum) the least fragment of proof that the Sophists or
        Protagoras did what he imputes to them (pp. 400-401-403-422).</p>
      <p>
        M. Lenormant, in his recent edition of the Kratylus (Comm. p.
        7-9), maintains also that neither the Sophists nor the Rhetors
        pretended to etymologise, nor are here ridiculed. But he
        ascribes to Plato in the Kratylus a mystical and theological
        purpose which I find it difficult to follow.</p>

        mock-etymologies, or to deride any one. Protagoras could not be
        ridiculed here. Neither Hermogenes nor Kratylus understand the
        etymologies as caricature.</span></p>
    <p>
      Suppose it then ascertained that Plato intended to ridicule and
      humiliate some rash etymologists, there would still be no
      propriety in singling out the Sophists as his victims &#8212; except
      that they are obnoxious names, against whom every unattested
      accusation is readily believed. But it is neither ascertained, nor
      (in my judgment) probable, that Plato here intended to ridicule or
      humiliate any one. The ridicule, if any was intended, would tell
      against himself more than against others. For he first begins by
      laying down a general theory respecting names: a theory
      unquestionably propounded as serious, and understood to be so by
      the critics:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_37" href="#Footnotev3_31_37"><span
          class="sp">37</span></a> moreover, involving some of his
      favourite and peculiar doctrines. It is this theory that his
      particular etymologies are announced as intended to carry out, in
      the way of illustration or exemplification. Moreover, he
      undertakes to prove this theory against Hermogenes, who declares
      himself strongly opposed to it: and he proves it by a string of
      arguments which (whether valid or not) are obviously given with a
      serious and sincere purpose of establishing the conclusion.
      Immediately after having established that there was a real
      rectitude of names, and after announcing that he would proceed to
      enquire wherein such rectitude consisted,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_38" href="#Footnotev3_31_38"><span
          class="sp">38</span></a> what sense or consistency would there
      be in his inventing a string of intentional caricatures announced
      as real etymologies? By doing this, he would be only discrediting
      and degrading the very theory which he had taken so much pains to
      inculcate upon Hermogenes. Instead of ridiculing Protagoras, he
      would ridicule himself and his own theory for the benefit of
      opponents generally, one among them being Protagoras: <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page307" id="v3page307"></a>307</span>who
      (if we imagine his life prolonged) would have had the satisfaction
      of seeing a theory, framed in direct opposition to his doctrine,
      discredited and parodied by his own advocate. Hermogenes, too
      (himself an opponent of the theory, though not concurring with
      Protagoras), if these etymologies were intended as caricatures,
      ought to be made to receive them as such, and to join in the joke
      at the expense of the persons derided. But Hermogenes is not made
      to manifest any sense of their being so intended: he accepts them
      all as serious, though some as novel and surprising, in the same
      passive way which is usual with the interlocutors of Sokrates in
      other dialogues. Farther, there are some among these etymologies
      plain and plausible enough, accepted as serious by all the
      critics.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_39" href="#Footnotev3_31_39"><span
          class="sp">39</span></a> Yet these are presented in the
      series, without being parted off by any definite line, along with
      those which we are called upon to regard as deliberate specimens
      of mock-etymology. Again, there are also some, which, looking at
      their etymological character, are as strange and surprising as any
      in the whole dialogue: but which yet, from the place which they
      occupy in the argument, and from the plain language in which they
      are presented, almost exclude the supposition that they can be
      intended as jest or caricature.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_40"

      <p>
        This occurs in the latter portion of the dialogue carried on by
        Sokrates with Kratylus, and is admitted by Lassalle to be
        seriously meant by Plato: though Lassalle maintains that the
        etymologies in the first part of the dialogue (between Sokrates
        and Hermogenes) are mere mockery and parody. (Lassalle,
        Herakleitos der Dunkle, vol. ii., pp. 402-403).</p>
      <p>
        I venture to say that none of those Platonic etymologies, which
        Lassalle regards as caricatures, are more absurd than those
        which he here accepts as serious. Liddell and Scott in their
        Lexicon say about &#952;&#965;&#956;&#972;&#962;, &#8220;probably rightly derived from &#952;&#973;&#969; by
        Plat. Crat. 419 E, &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#950;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962;.&#8221; The
        manner in which Schleiermacher and Steinhart also (Einleit. zum
        Kratylos, pp. 552-554), analysing this dialogue, represent Plato
        as passing backwards and forwards from mockery to earnest and
        from earnest to mockery, appears to me very singular: as well as
        the principle which Schleiermacher lays down (Introduct. p. 10),
        that Plato intended the general doctrines to be seriously
        understood, and the particular etymological applications to be
        mere mockery and extravagance (um wer weiss welche Kom&ouml;die
        aufzuf&uuml;hren). What other philosopher has ever propounded
        serious doctrines, and then followed them up by illustrations
        knowingly and intentionally caricatured so as to disparage the
        doctrines instead of recommending them?</p>
      <p>
        <span class="correction" title="amended from 'Is'">It</span> is surely less difficult to believe that Plato conceived as
        plausible and admissible those etymologies which appear to us
        absurd.</p>
      <p>
        As a specimen of the view entertained by able men of the
        seventeenth century respecting the Platonic and Aristotelian
        etymologies, see the Institutiones Logic&aelig; of
        Burgersdicius, Lib. i. c. 25, not. 1. Lehrsch (Die
        Sprachphilosophie der Alten, Part i. p. 34-35) agrees with the
        other commentators, that the Platonic etymologies in the
        Kratylus are caricatured to deride the boastful and arbitrary
        etymologies of the Sophists about language. But he too produces
        no evidence of such etymologies on the part of the Sophists;
        nay, what is remarkable, he supposes that <i>both</i>
        Protagoras and Prodikus agreed in the Platonic doctrine that
        names were &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; (see pp. 17-19).</p>

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_20"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_20"></a>Plato intended his theory as
        serious, but his exemplifications as admissible guesses. He does
        not cite particular cases as proofs of a theory, but only as
        illustrating what he means.</span></p>
    <p>
      I cannot therefore accept as well-founded this &#8220;discovery of
      modern times,&#8221; which represents the Platonic etymologies in the
      Kratylus as intentionally extravagant and knowingly caricatured,
      for the purpose of ridiculing the Sophists or others. In my
      judgment, Plato did not put them forward as extravagant, nor for
      the purpose of ridiculing any one, but as genuine illustrations of
      a theory of his own respecting names. It cannot be said indeed
      that he advanced them as proof of his theory: for Plato seldom
      appeals to particulars, except when he has a theory to attack.
      When he has a theory to lay down, he does not generally<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page309" id="v3page309"></a>309</span>
      recognise the necessity of either proving or verifying it by
      application to particular cases. His proof is usually deductive or
      derived from some more general principle asserted <i>&agrave;
        priori</i> &#8212; some internal sentiment enunciated as a
      self-justifying maxim. Particular examples serve to illustrate
      what the principle is, but are not required to establish its
      validity.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_42" href="#Footnotev3_31_42"><span
          class="sp">42</span></a> But I believe that he intended his
      particular etymologies as <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> guesses, more or
      less probable (like the developments in the Tim&aelig;us, which he<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_43" href="#Footnotev3_31_43"><span
          class="sp">43</span></a> repeatedly designates as &#949;&#7984;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;, and
      nothing beyond): some certain, some doubtful, some merely novel
      and ingenious: such as would naturally spring from the originating
      <i>afflatus</i> of diviners (like Euthyphron, to whom he alludes
      more than once<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_44" href="#Footnotev3_31_44"><span
          class="sp">44</span></a>) who stepped beyond the ordinary
      regions of human affirmation. Occasionally he proposes alternative
      and distinct etymologies: <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page310" id="v3page310"></a>310</span>feeling assured
      that there was some way of making out the conclusion &#8212; but not
      feeling equally certain about his own way of making it out. The
      sentiment of belief attaches itself in Plato&#8217;s mind to general
      views and theorems: when he gives particular consequences as
      flowing from them, his belief graduates down through all the
      stages between full certainty and the lowest probability, until in
      some cases it becomes little more than a fanciful illustration &#8212;
      like the mythes which he so often invents to expand and enliven
      these same general views.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_45"

        The third portion of Lehrsch&#8217;s work, <i>Ueber die
          Sprachphilosophie der Alten</i>, cites numerous examples of
        the etymologies attempted by the ancients, from Homer downwards,
        many of them collected from the Etymologicon Magnum. When we
        read the etymologies propounded seriously by Greek and Latin
        philosophers (especially the Stoic Chrysippus), literary men,
        jurists, and poets, we shall not be astonished at those found in
        the Platonic Kratylus. The etymology of &#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, given
        in the Kratylus (p. 397 D), as well as in the Pythagorean
        Philolaus (see Boeckh, Philolaus, pp. 168-175), and repeated by
        Clemens Alexandrinus, is not more absurd than that of &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#8056;
        &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945;&#953;, given by Herodot. ii. 52, and also repeated by
        Clemens, see Wesseling&#8217;s note. None of the etymologies of the
        Kratylus is more strange than that of &#918;&#949;&#8058;&#962;-&#916;&#943;&#945;-&#918;&#8134;&#957;&#945; (p. 396 B).
        Yet this is reproduced in the Pseudo-Aristotelian Treatise, &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
        &#922;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#965; (p. 401, a. 15), as well as by the Stoic Zeno (Diogen.
        Laert. vii. 147). The treatise of Cornutus, De Nat. Deor. with
        Osann&#8217;s Commentary, is instructive in enabling us to appreciate
        the taste of ancient times as to what was probable or admissible
        in etymology. There are few of the etymologies in the Kratylus
        more singular than that of &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; from &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7938; &#8005;&#960;&#969;&#960;&#949;&#957;. Yet
        this is cited by Ammonius as a perfectly good derivation, ad
        Aristot. De Interpret. p. 103, b. 8, Schol. Bekk., and also in
        the Etymologicon Magnum.</p>

        Compare Plato, Euthyphron, p. 6 D. Origination and invention
        often pass in Plato as the workings of an ordinary mind
        (sometimes even a feeble mind) worked upon from without by
        divine inspiration, quite distinct from the internal force,
        reasoning, judging, testing, which belongs to a powerful mind.

    <p>
      We must remember that Sokrates in the Kratylus explicitly
      announces himself as having no formed opinion on the subject, and
      as competent only to the prosecution of the enquiry, jointly with
      the others. What he says must therefore be received as conjectures
      proposed for discussion. I see no ground for believing that he
      regarded any of them, even those which appear to us the strangest,
      as being absurd or extravagant &#8212; or that he proposed any of them
      in mockery and caricature, for the purpose of deriding other
      Etymologists. Because these etymologies, or many of them at least,
      appear to us obviously absurd, we are not warranted in believing
      that they must have appeared so to Plato. They did not appear so
      (as I have already observed) to Dionysius of Halikarnassus &#8212; nor
      to Diogenes, nor to the Platonists of antiquity nor to any critics
      earlier than the seventeenth century.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_46"

      of these critics they were deemed not merely serious, but
      valuable. Nor are they more absurd than many of the etymologies
      proposed by Aristotle, by the Stoics, by the Alexandrine critics,
      by Varro, and by the <i>grammatici</i> or literary men of
      antiquity generally; moreover, even by Plato himself in other

      determining what etymologies would appear to Plato reasonable or
      admissible, Dionysius, Plutarch, Proklus, and Alkinous, are more
      likely to judge rightly than we: partly because they had a larger
      knowledge of the etymologies proposed by Greek philosophers and <i>grammatici</i>
      than we possess &#8212; partly because they had no acquaintance with the
      enlarged views of modern etymologists &#8212; which, on the point here
      in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page312" id="v3page312"></a>312</span>question,
      are misleading rather than otherwise. Plato held the general
      theory that names, in so far as they were framed with perfect
      rectitude, held embodied in words and syllables a likeness or
      imitation of the essence of things. And if he tried to follow out
      such a theory into detail, without any knowledge of grammatical
      systems, without any large and well-chosen collection of analogies
      within his own language, or any comparison of different languages
      with each other &#8212; he could scarcely fail to lose himself in
      wonderful and violent transmutations of letters and syllables.<a

      <p>
        We read in the Ph&aelig;drus of Plato (p. 244 B) in the second
        speech ascribed to Sokrates, two etymologies:&#8212; 1. &#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;
        derived from &#956;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; by the insertion of &#964;, which Sokrates
        declares to be done in bad taste, &#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#964;&#8056; <span

        &#959;&#7984;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;, quasi &#959;&#7984;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#776;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;, from &#959;&#7988;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, &#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;.
        Compare the etymology of &#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962;, p. 238 C. That these are real
        word-changes, which Plato believes to have taken place, is the
        natural and reasonable interpretation of the passage. Cicero
        (Divinat. i. 1) alludes to the first of the two as Plato&#8217;s real
        opinion; and Heindorf as well as Schleiermacher accept it in the
        same sense, while expressing their surprise at the want of
        etymological perspicacity in Plato. Ast and Stallbaum, on the
        contrary, declare that these two etymologies are mere irony and
        mockery, spoken by Plato, <i>ex mente Sophistarum</i>, and
        intended as a sneer at the perverse and silly Sophists. No
        reason is produced by Ast and Stallbaum to justify this
        hypothesis, except that you cannot imagine &#8220;<i>Platonem tam
          c&aelig;cum fuisse</i>,&#8221; &amp;c. To me this reason is utterly
        insufficient; and I contend, moreover, that sneers at the
        Sophists would be quite out of place in a speech, such as the
        palinode of Sokrates about Eros.</p>

        Stallbaum, after having complimented Plato for his talent in

        to find Aristotle reproducing some of these very caricatures as
        serious, see Stallbaum&#8217;s note on Kratyl. p. 411 E.</p>
      <p>
        Respecting the etymologies proposed by learned and able Romans
        in and before the Ciceronian and Augustan age, &AElig;lius
        Stilo, Varro, Labeo, Nigidius, &amp;c., see Aulus Gellius, xiii.
        10; Quintilian, Inst. Or. i. 5; Varro, de Lingu&acirc;
        Latin&acirc;.</p>
      <p>
        Even to Quintilian, the etymologies of Varro appeared
        preposterous; and he observes, in reference to those proposed by
        &AElig;lius Stilo and by others afterwards, &#8220;Cui non post
        Varronem sit venia?&#8221; (i. 6, 37). This critical remark, alike
        good tempered and reasonable, might be applied with still
        greater pertinence to the Kratylus of Plato. In regard to
        etymology, more might have been expected from Varro than from
        Plato; for in the days of Plato, etymological guesses were
        almost a novelty; while during the three centuries which elapsed
        between him and Varro, many such conjectures had been hazarded
        by various scholars, and more or less of improvement might be
        hoped from the conflict of opposite opinions and thinkers.</p>

        M. Gaston Boissier (in his interesting &Eacute;tude sur la vie
        et les Ouvrages de M. Terentius Varron, p. 152, Paris, 1861)
        observes respecting Varro, what is still more applicable to
        Plato:&#8212; &#8220;Gardons nous bien d&#8217;ailleurs de demander &agrave;
        Varron ce qu&#8217;exige la science moderne: pour n&#8217;&ecirc;tre pas

        quum nomen Pascha a gr&aelig;co verbo &#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; repetunt, non per

        Gr&auml;fenhahn (Gesch. d. classichen Philologie, vol. i. sect.
        36, pp. 151-164) points out how common was the hypothesis of
        fanciful derivation of names or supposed etymologies among the
        Greek poets, and how it passed from them to the prose writers.
        He declares that the etymologies in Plato not only in the
        Kratylus but in other dialogues are &#8220;etymologische monstra,&#8221; but
        he professes inability to distinguish which of them are serious
        (pp. 163-164).</p>
      <p>
        Lobeck remarks that the playing and quibbling with words, widely
        diffused among the ancient literati generally, was especially
        likely to belong to those who held the Platonic theory about
        language:&#8212; &#8220;Is intelligat necesse est, hoc universum genus <span

        Sokrates endeavours to explain how it is that the Names
        originally right have become so disguised and spoiled.</span></p>
    <p>
      Having expressed my opinion that the etymologies propounded by
      Sokrates in the Kratylus are not intended as caricatures, but as <i>bon&acirc;
        fide</i> specimens of admissible etymological conjecture, or, at
      the least, of discoverable analogy &#8212; I resume the thread of the
      dialogue.</p>
    <p>
      These etymologies are the hypothetical links whereby Sokrates
      reconciles his first theory of the essential rectitude of Names
      (that is, of Naming, as a process which can only be performed in
      one way, and by an Artist who discerns and uses the Name-Form),
      with the names actually received and current. The contrast between
      the sameness and perfection postulated in the theory, and the
      confusion of actual practice, is not less manifest than the
      contrast between the benevolent purposes ascribed to the Demiurgus
      (in the Tim&aelig;us) and the realities of man and society:&#8212;
      requiring intermediate assumptions, more or less ingenious, to
      explain or attenuate the glaring inconsistencies. Respecting the
      Name-Form, Sokrates intimates that it may often be so disguised by
      difference of letters and syllables, as not to be discernible by
      an <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page313" id="v3page313"></a>313</span>ordinary
      man, or by any one except an artist or philosopher. Two names, if
      compound, may have the same Name-Form, though few or none of the
      letters in them be the same. A physician may so disguise his
      complex mixtures, by apparent differences of colour or smell, that
      they shall be supposed by others to be different, though
      essentially the same. <i>Beta</i> is the name of the letter B:
      you may substitute, in place of the three last letters, any others
      which you prefer, and the name will still be appropriate to
      designate the letter B.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_49"

      from this point, and we must follow in their synthetical track. We
      must distinguish letters with their essential forms &#8212; we must also
      distinguish things with their essential forms &#8212; we must then
      assign to each essence of things that essence of letters which has
      a natural aptitude to signify it, either one letter singly or

      This extreme postulate of analysis and adaptation may be compared
      with that which Sokrates lays down, in the Ph&aelig;drus, in
      regard to the art of Rhetoric. You must first distinguish all the

    <p>
      Essential aptitude for signification consists in resemblance
      between the essence of the letter and that of the thing signified.
      Thus the letter <i>Rho</i>, according to Sokrates, is naturally
      apt for the signification of rush or vehement motion, because in
      pronouncing it the tongue is briskly agitated and rolled about.
      Several words are cited, illustrating this position.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_53" href="#Footnotev3_31_53"><span
          class="sp">53</span></a> <i>Iota</i> naturally<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page314" id="v3page314"></a>314</span>
      designates thin and subtle things, which insinuate themselves
      everywhere. <i>Phi</i>, <i>Chi</i>, <i>Psi</i>, <i>Sigma</i>,
      the sibilants, imitate blowing. <i>Delta</i> and <i>Tau</i>,
      from the compression of the tongue, imitate stoppage of motion, or
      stationary condition. <i>Lambda</i> imitates smooth and slippery
      things. <i>Nu</i> serves, as confining the voice in the mouth, to
      form the words signifying in-doors and interior. <i>Alpha</i> and
      <i>Eta</i> are both of them large letters: the first is assigned
      to signify size, the last to signify length. <i>Omicron</i> is
      suited to what is round or circular.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_54"

        Leibnitz (Nouveaux Essais sur l&#8217;Entendement Humain, Book iii.
        ch. 2, p. 300 Erdm.); and Jacob Grimm (in his Dissertation
        Ueber den Ursprung der Sprache, Berlin, 1858, ed. 4) give views
        very similar to those of Plato, respecting the primordial growth
        of language, and the original significant or symbolising power
        supposed to be inherent in each letter (Kein Buchstabe,
        &#8220;urspr&uuml;nglich steht bedeutungslos oder ueberfl&uuml;ssig,&#8221;
        pp. 39-40). Leibnitz and Grimm say (as Plato here also affirms)
        that Rho designates the Rough &#8212; Lambda, the Smooth: see also
        what he says about Alpha, Iota, Hypsilon. Compare, besides, M.
        Renan, Orig. du Langage, vi. p. 137.</p>
      <p>
        The comparison of the Platonic speculations on the primordial
        powers of letters, with those of a modern linguistic scholar so
        illustrious as Grimm (the earliest speculations with the latest)
        are exceedingly curious &#8212; and honourable to Plato. They serve as
        farther reasons for believing that this dialogue was not
        intended to caricature Protagoras.</p>

      It is from these fundamental aptitudes, and some others analogous,
      that the name-giving Artist, or Lawgiver, first put together
      letters to compound and construct his names. Herein consists their
      rectitude, according to Sokrates. Though in laying down the
      position Sokrates gives it only as the best which <i>he</i> could
      discover, and intimates that some persons may turn it into
      derision &#8212; yet he evidently means to be understood seriously.<a

      Many names (pursues Sokrates), having been given by artistic
      lawgivers who believed in the Herakleitean theory, will possess
      intrinsic rectitude, if we assume that theory to be true. But how
      if the theory be not true? and if the name-givers were mistaken on

      must not assume the theory to be true, although the Name-givers
      believed it to be so. Perhaps they themselves (Sokrates intimates)
      having become giddy by often turning round to survey the nature of
      things, mistook this <i>vertige</i> of their own for a perpetual
      revolution and movement of the things which they saw, and gave

        his original thesis.</span></p>
    <p>
      To this point Sokrates brings the question during his conversation
      with Hermogenes: against whom he maintains &#8212; That there is a
      natural intrinsic rectitude in Names, or a true Name-Form &#8212; that
      naming is a process which must be performed in the natural way,
      and by an Artist who knows that way. But when, after laying down
      this general theory, he has gone a certain length in applying it
      to actual names, he proceeds to introduce qualifications which
      attenuate and explain it away. Existing names were bestowed by
      artistic law-givers, but under a belief in the Herakleitean theory
      &#8212; which theory is at best doubtful: moreover the original names
      have, in course of time, undergone such multiplied changes, that
      the original point of significant resemblance can hardly be now
      recognised except by very penetrating intellects.</p>

        Kratylus: who upholds that original thesis without any
        qualification.</span></p>
    <p>
      It is here that Sokrates comes into conversation with Kratylus:
      who appears as the unreserved advocate of the same general theory
      which Sokrates had enforced upon Hermogenes. He admits all the
      consequences of the theory, taking no account of qualifications.
      Moreover he announces himself as having already bestowed
      reflection on the subject, and as espousing the doctrine of
      Herakleitus.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_62" href="#Footnotev3_31_62"><span

        Plato, Kratyl. pp. 428 B, 440 E.</p>
      <p>
        It appears that on this point the opinion of Herakleitus
        coincided with that of the Pythagoreans, who held that names
        were &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016; &#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953; and maintained as a corollary that there
        could be only one name for each thing and only one thing
        signified by each name (Simplikius ad Aristot. Categ. p. 43, b.
        32, Schol. Bekk.).</p>
      <p>
        In general Herakleitus differed from Pythagoras, and is
        described as speaking of him with bitter antipathy.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If names are significant by natural rectitude, or by partaking of
      the Name-Form, it follows that all names must be right or true,
      one as well as another. If a name be not right, it cannot be
      significant: that is, it is no name at all: it is a mere unmeaning
      sound. A name, in order to be significant, must imitate the
      essence of the thing named. If you add any thing to a number, or
      subtract any thing from it, it becomes thereby a new number: it is
      not the same number badly rendered. So with a letter: so too with
      a name. There is no such thing as a bad name. Every name must be
      either significant, and therefore, right &#8212; or else it is not a
      name. So also there is no such thing as <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page317" id="v3page317"></a>317</span>a false
      proposition: you cannot say the thing that is not: your words in
      that case have no meaning; they are only an empty sound. The
      hypothesis that the law-giver may have distributed names
      erroneously is therefore not admissible.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_63"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>
      Moreover, you see that he must have known well, for otherwise he
      would not have given names so consistent with each other, and with
      the general Herakleitean theory.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_64"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> And
      since the name is by necessity a representation or copy of the
      thing, whoever knows the name, must also know the thing named.
      There is in fact no other way of knowing or seeking or finding out
      things, except through their names.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_65"

        The critics say that these last words ought to be read &#7970;&#957; &#964;&#8056;
        &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#8150;, as Ficinus has translated, and Schleiermacher after
        him. They are probably in the right; at the same time, reasoning
        upon the theory of Kratylus, we say without impropriety, that
        &#8220;the thing indicates the name&#8221;.</p>
      <p>
        That which is erroneously called a bad name is no name at all
        (so Kratylus argues), but only seems to be a name to ignorant
        persons. Thus also in the Platonic Minos (c. 9, p. 317): a bad
        law is no law in reality, but only seems to be a law to ignorant
        men, see above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40436/40436-h/40436-h.htm#v2page88">ch. xiv. p. <span

        These last words allude to the various particular etymologies
        which had been enumerated by Sokrates as illustrations of the
        Herakleitean theory. They confirm the opinion above expressed,
        that Plato intended his etymologies seriously, not as mockery or
        caricature. That Plato should have intended them as caricatures
        of Protagoras and Prodikus, and yet that he should introduce
        Kratylus as welcoming them in support of <i>his</i> argument,
        is a much greater absurdity than the supposition that Plato
        mistook them for admissible guesses.</p>

    <p>
      These consequences are fairly deduced by Kratylus from the
      hypothesis, of the natural rectitude of names, as laid down in the
      beginning of the dialogue, by Sokrates: who had expressly affirmed
      (in his anti-Protagorean opening of the dialogue) that unless the
      process of naming was performed according to the peremptory
      dictates of nature and by one of the few privileged name-givers,
      it would be a failure and would accomplish nothing;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_66" href="#Footnotev3_31_66"><span
          class="sp">66</span></a> in other words, that a <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page318" id="v3page318"></a>318</span>non-natural
      name would be no name at all. Accordingly, in replying to
      Kratylus, Sokrates goes yet farther in retracting his own previous
      reasoning at the beginning of the dialogue &#8212; though still without
      openly professing to do so. He proposes a compromise.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_67" href="#Footnotev3_31_67"><span
          class="sp">67</span></a> He withdraws the pretensions of his
      theory, as peremptory or exclusive; he acknowledges the theory of
      Hermogenes as true, and valid in conjunction with it. He admits
      that non-natural names also, significant only by convention, are
      available as a make-shift &#8212; and that such names are in frequent
      use. Still however he contends, that natural names, significant by
      likeness, are the best, so far as they can be obtained: but
      inasmuch as that principle will not afford sufficiently extensive
      holding-ground, recourse must be had by way of supplement to the
      less perfect rectitude (of names) presented by customary or
      conventional significance.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_68"

    <p>
      You say (reasons Sokrates with Kratylus) that names must be
      significant by way of likeness. But there are degrees of
      likeness. A portrait is more or less like its original, but it is
      never exactly like: it is never a duplicate, nor does it need to
      be so. Or a portrait, which really belongs to and resembles one
      person, may be erroneously assigned to another. The same thing
      happens with names. There are names more or less like the thing
      named &#8212; good or bad: there are names good with reference to their
      own object, but erroneously fitted on to objects not their own.
      The name does not cease to be a name, so long as the type or form
      of the thing named is preserved in it: but it is worse or better,
      according as the accompanying features are more or less in harmony
      with the form.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_69" href="#Footnotev3_31_69"><span
          class="sp">69</span></a> If names are like things, the letters
      which are put together to form names, must have a natural
      resemblance to things &#8212; as we remarked above respecting the
      letters Rho, Lambda, &amp;c. But the natural, inherent, powers of
      resemblance and significance, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page319" id="v3page319"></a>319</span>which we
      pronounced to belong to these letters, are not found to pervade
      all the actual names, in which they are employed. There are words
      containing the letters <i>Rho</i> and <i>Lambda</i>, in a sense
      opposite to that which is natural to them &#8212; yet nevertheless at
      the same time significant; as is evident from the fact, that you
      and I and others understand them alike. Here then are words
      significant, without resembling: significant altogether through
      habit and convention. We must admit the principle of convention as
      an inferior ground and manner of significance. Resemblance, though
      the best ground as far as it can be had, is not the only one.<a

        the theory of Herakleitus: some are opposed to it.</span></p>
    <p>
      All names are not like the things named: some names are bad,
      others good: the law-giver sometimes gave names under an erroneous
      belief. Hence you are not warranted in saying that things must be
      known and investigated through names, and that whoever knows the
      name, knows also the thing named. You say that the names given are
      all coherent and grounded upon the Herakleitean theory of
      perpetual flux. You take this as a proof that that theory is true
      in itself, and that the law-giver adopted and proceeded upon it as
      true. I agree with you that the law-giver or name-giver believed
      in the Herakleitean theory, and adapted many of his names to it:
      but you cannot infer from hence that the theory is true &#8212; for he
      may have been mistaken.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_71"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
      Moreover, though many of the existing names consist with, and are
      based upon, that theory, the same cannot be said of all names.
      Many names can be enumerated which are based on the opposite
      principle of permanence and stand-still. It is unsafe to strike a
      balance of mere numbers between the two: besides which, even among
      the various names founded on the Herakleitean theory, you will
      find jumbled together the names of virtues and vices, benefits and
      misfortunes. That theory lends itself to good and evil alike; it
      cannot therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page320"

        These words appear to me to imply that Sokrates is perfectly
        serious, and not ironical, in delivering his opinion, that the
        original imposers of names were believers in the Herakleitean
        theory.</p>

        Sokrates here enumerates the particular names illustrating his

      Lastly, even if we granted that things may be known and studied
      through their names, it is certain that there must be some other
      way of knowing them; since the first name-givers (as you yourself
      affirm) knew things, at a time when no names existed.<a

        Plato, Krat. p. 438 A-B. Kratylus here suggests that the first
        names may perhaps have been imposed by a super-human power. But
        Sokrates replies, that upon that supposition all the names must
        have been imposed upon the same theory: there could not have
        been any contradiction between one name and another.</p>

      Sokrates then concludes the dialogue by opposing the Platonic
      ideas to the Herakleitean theory. I often dream or imagine the

      The Herakleitean theory of constant and universal flux is true
      respecting particular things, but not true respecting these Ideas
      or Forms. It is the latter alone which know or are known: it is
      they alone which admit of being rightly named. For that which is
      in perpetual flux and change can neither know, nor be known, nor
      be rightly named.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_76"

      To admit these permanent and unchangeable Forms is to deny the

      This is a debate still open and not easy to decide. But while it
      is yet undecided, no wise man ought to put such implicit faith in

    <p>
      One of the most learned among the modern Platonic commentators
      informs us that the purpose of Plato in this dialogue was, &#8220;to rub
      over Protagoras and other Sophists with the bitterest salt of
      sarcasm&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_79" href="#Footnotev3_31_79"><span
          class="sp">79</span></a> I have already expressed my dissent
      from this theory, which is opposed to all the ancient views of the
      dialogue, and which has arisen, in my judgment, only from the
      anxiety of the moderns to exonerate Plato from the reproach of
      having suggested as admissible, etymologies which now appear to us

      whether conclusive or not &#8212; is serious and not derisory. The
      discourse of Sokrates is neither that of an anti-sophistical
      caricaturist, on the one hand &#8212; nor that of a confirmed dogmatist
      who has studied the subject and made up his mind on the other

      enquirer groping after truth, who follows the suggestive
      promptings of his own invention, without knowing whither it will
      conduct him: who, having in his mind different and even opposite
      points of view, unfolds first arguments on behalf of one, and next
      those on behalf of the other, without pledging himself either to
      the one or to the other, or to any definite scheme of compromise
      between them.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_82" href="#Footnotev3_31_82"><span

      circuitous gropings and guesses of an inquisitive and yet
      unsatisfied mind &#8212; those who ask for nothing but a conclusion
      clearly enunciated along with one or two affirmative reasons &#8212; may
      find the dialogue tiresome. However this may be &#8212; it is a manner
      found in many Platonic dialogues.</p>

          priori</i>, in the first part &#8212; Great difficulty, and
        ingenuity necessary, to bring it into harmony with facts.</span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Sokrates opens his case by declaring the thesis of the Absolute
      (Object <i>sine</i> Subject), against the Protagorean thesis of
      the Relative (Object <i>cum</i> Subject). Things have an absolute
      essence: names have an absolute essence:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_83"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page323" id="v3page323"></a>323</span>each
      name belongs to its own thing, and to no other: this is its
      rectitude: none but that rare person, the artistic name-giver, can
      detect the essence of each thing, and the essence of each name, so
      as to apply the name rightly. Here we have a theory truly
      Platonic: impressed upon Plato&#8217;s mind by a sentiment <i>&agrave;
        priori</i>, and not from any survey or comparison of
      particulars. Accordingly when Sokrates is called upon to apply his
      theory to existing current words, and to make out how any such
      rectitude can be shown to belong to them &#8212; he finds the greatest
      divergence and incongruity between the two. His ingenuity is
      hardly tasked to reconcile them: and he is obliged to have
      recourse to bold and multiplied hypotheses. That the first
      Name-Givers were artists proceeding upon system, but incompetent
      artists proceeding on a bad system &#8212; they were Herakleiteans who
      believed in the universality of movement, and gave names having
      reference to movement:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_84"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> That the
      various letters of the alphabet, or rather the different actions
      of the vocal organism by which they are pronounced, have each an
      inherent, essential, adaptation, or analogy to the phenomena of
      movement or arrest of movement:<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_85"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> That the
      names originally bestowed have become disguised by a variety of
      metamorphoses, but may be <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page324" id="v3page324"></a>324</span>brought back to
      their original by probable suppositions, and shown to possess the
      rectitude sought. All these hypotheses are only violent efforts to
      reconcile the Platonic <i>&agrave; priori</i> theory, in some way
      or other, with existing facts of language. To regard them as
      intentional caricatures, would be to suppose that Plato is seeking
      intentionally to discredit and deride his own theory of the
      Absolute: for the discredit could fall nowhere else. We see that
      Plato considered many of his own guesses as strange and novel,
      some even as laying him open to ridicule.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_86" href="#Footnotev3_31_86"><span
          class="sp">86</span></a> But they were indispensable to bring
      his theory into something like coherence, however inadequate, with
      real language.</p>

        One cannot but notice how Plato, shortly after having declared
        war against the Relativity affirmed by Protagoras, falls himself
        into that very track of Relativity when he comes to speak about
        actual language, telling us that names are imposed on grounds
        dependant on or relative to the knowledge or belief of the
        Name-givers. Kratylus, pp. 397 B, 399 A, 401 A-B, 411 B, 436 B.</p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Leibnitz conceived an idea of a &#8220;Lingua Characterica
        Universalis, qu&aelig; simul sit ars inveniendi et judicandi&#8221;
        (see Leibnitz Opp. Erdmann, pp. 162-163), and he alludes to a
        conception of Jacob B&ouml;hme, that there once existed a Lingua
        Adamica or Natur-Sprache, through which the essences of things
        might be contemplated and understood. &#8220;Lingua Adamica vel
        cert&eacute; vis ejus, quam quidam se nosse, et in nominibus ab
        Adamo impositis essentias rerum intueri posse contendunt &#8212; nobis
        cert&eacute; ignota est&#8221; (Opp. p. 93). Leibnitz seems to have
        thought that it was possible to construct a philosophical
        language, based upon an Alphabetum Cogitationum Humanarum,
        through which problems on all subjects might be resolved, by a <i>calculus</i>
        like that which is employed for the solution of arithmetical or
        geometrical problems (Opp. p. 83; compare also p. 356).</p>
      <p>
        This is very analogous to the affirmations of Sokrates, in the
        first part of the Kratylus, about the essentiality of Names
        discovered and declared by the &#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</p>

        Plato, Krat. pp. 424-425. Schleiermacher declares this to be
        among the greatest and most profound truths which have ever been
        enunciated about language (Introduction to Kratylus, p. 11).
        Stallbaum, on the contrary, regards it as not even seriously
        meant, but mere derision of others (Prolegg. ad Krat. p. 12).
        Another commentator on Plato calls it &#8220;eine Lehre der
        Sophistischen Sprachforscher&#8220; (August Arnold, Einleitung in die
        Philosophie &#8212; durch die Lehre Platons vermittelt &#8212; p. 178,
        Berlin, 1841).</p>
      <p>
        Proklus, in his Commentary, says that the scope of this dialogue
        is to exhibit the imitative or generative faculty which
        essentially belongs to the mind, and whereby the mind (aided by
        the vocal or pronunciative imagination &#8212; &#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;)
        constructs names which are natural transcripts of the essences
        of things (Proklus, Schol. ad Kratyl. pp. 1-21 ed. Boissonnade;
        Alkinous, Introd. ad Platon. c. 6).</p>
      <p>
        Ficinus, too, in his argument to the Kratylus (p. 768), speaks
        much about the mystic sanctity of names, recognised not merely
        by Pythagoras and Plato, but also by the Jews and Orientals. He
        treats the etymologies in the Kratylus as seriously intended. He
        says not a word about any intention on the part of Plato to
        deride the Sophists or any other Etymologists.</p>
      <p>
        So also Sydenham, in his translation of Plato&#8217;s Phil&ecirc;bus
        (p. 33), designates the Kratylus as &#8220;a dialogue in which is
        taught the nature of things, as well the permanent as the
        transient, by a supposed etymology of Names and Words&#8221;.</p>

        Plato, Kratyl. pp. 425 D, 426 B. Because Sokrates says that
        these etymologies may appear ridiculous, we are not to infer
        that he proposed them as caricatures; see what Plato says in the
        Republic, v. p. 452, about his own propositions respecting the
        training of women, which others (he says) will think ludicrous,
        but which he proposes with the most thorough and serious
        conviction.</p>

        the last half of the dialogue &#8212; he disconnects his theory of
        Naming from the Herakleitean doctrine.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the second part of the dialogue, where Kratylus is introduced
      as uncompromising champion of this same theory, Sokrates changes
      his line of argument, and impugns the peremptory or exclusive
      pretensions of the theory: first denying some legitimate
      corollaries from it &#8212; next establishing by the side of it the
      counter-theory of Hermogenes, as being an inferior though
      indispensable auxiliary &#8212; yet still continuing to uphold it as an
      ideal of what is Best. He concludes by disconnecting the theory
      pointedly from the doctrine of Herakleitus, with which Kratylus
      connected it, and by maintaining that there can be no right
      naming, and no sound knowledge, if that doctrine be admitted.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_87" href="#Footnotev3_31_87"><span
          class="sp">87</span></a> The Platonic Ideas, eternal and
      unchangeable, are finally opposed to Kratylus as the only objects
      truly knowable and nameable &#8212; and therefore as the only conditions
      under which right naming can be realised. The Name-givers of
      actual society have failed in their task by proceeding on a wrong
      doctrine: neither they nor the names which they have given can be
      trusted.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_88" href="#Footnotev3_31_88"><span

        Plato, Kratyl. p. 440 C. Compare pp. 436 D, 439 B.</p>
      <p>
        Lassalle contends that Herakleitus and his followers considered
        the knowledge of names to be not only indispensable to the
        knowledge of things, but equivalent to and essentially embodying
        that knowledge. (Herakleitos, vol. ii. pp. 363-368-387.) See
        also a passage of Proklus, in his Commentary on the Platonic
        Parmenid&ecirc;s, p. 476, ed. Stallbaum.</p>
      <p>
        The remarkable passage in the first book of Aristotle&#8217;s
        Metaphysica, wherein he speaks of Plato and Plato&#8217;s early
        familiarity with Kratylus and the Herakleitean opinions,
        coincides very much with the course of the Platonic dialogue
        Kratylus, from its beginning to its end (Aristot. Metaphys. A.
        p. 987 a-b).</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      How this is to be done, Sokrates professes himself unable to say.
      We may presume him to mean, that a true Artistic Name-giver must
      set the example, knowing these Forms or essences beforehand, and
      providing for each its appropriate Name, or Name-Form, significant
      by essential analogy.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_39"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_39"></a>Ideal of the best system of naming &#8212;
        the Name-Giver ought to be familiar with the Platonic Ideas or
        Essences, and apportion his names according to resemblances
        among them.</span></p>
    <p>
      Herein, so far as I can understand, consists the amount of
      positive inference which Plato enables us to draw from the
      Kratylus. Sokrates began by saying that names having natural
      rectitude were the only materials out of which a language could be
      formed: he ends by affirming merely that this is the best and most
      perfect mode of formation: he admits that names may become
      significant, though loosely and imperfectly, by convention alone &#8212;
      yet the best scheme would be, that in which they are significant
      by inherent resemblance to the thing named. But this cannot be
      done until the Name-giver, instead of proceeding upon the false
      theory of Herakleitus, starts from the true theory recognising the
      reality of eternal, unchangeable, Ideas or Forms. He will
      distinguish, and embody in appropriate syllables, those Forms of
      Names which truly resemble, and have natural connection with, the
      Forms of Things.</p>
    <p>
      Such is the ideal of perfect or philosophical Naming, as Plato
      conceives it &#8212; disengaged from those divinations of the origin and
      metamorphoses of existing names, which occupy so much of the
      dialogue.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_89" href="#Footnotev3_31_89"><span
          class="sp">89</span></a> He does not indeed attempt to
      construct a body <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page326"
          id="v3page326"></a>326</span>of true names <i>&agrave; priori</i>,
      but he sets forth the real nameable permanent essences, to which
      these names might be assimilated: <span class="pagenum"><a

          class="sp">90</span></a> and he contrasts this process with
      two rival processes, each defective in its own way. This same
      contrast, pervading Plato&#8217;s views on other subjects, deserves a
      few words of illustration.</p>

        Deuschle (Die Platonische Sprachphilosophie, p. 57) tells us

        I see no probability in such an hypothesis.</p>
      <p>
        Respecting the origin and primordial signification of language,
        a great variety of different opinions have been started.</p>
      <p>
        William von Humboldt (Werke, vi. 80) assumes that there must
        have been some primitive and natural bond between each sound and
        its meaning (<i>i.e.</i> that names were originally significant
        &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;), though there are very few particular cases in which such
        connexion can be brought to evidence or even divined. (Here we
        see that the larger knowledge of etymology possessed at present
        deters the modern philologer from that which Plato undertakes in
        the Kratylus.) He distinguishes a threefold relation between the
        name and the thing signified. 1. Directly imitative. 2.
        Indirectly imitative or symbolical. 3. Imitative by one remove,
        or analogical: where a name becomes transferred from one object
        to another, by virtue of likeness between the two objects.
        (Ueber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und
        ihren Einfluss auf die geistige Entwicklung des
        Menschengeschlechtes, p. 78, Berlin, 1880.)</p>
      <p>
        Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, in his Etymology of the English Language
        (see Prelim. Disc. p. 10 seq.), recognises the same imitative
        origin, and tries to apply the principle to particular English
        words. Mr. F. W. Farrar, in his recent interesting work
        (Chapters on Language) has explained and enforced copiously the
        like thesis &#8212; onomatop&#339;ic origin for language generally. He has
        combated the objections of Professor Max M&uuml;ller, who
        considers the principle to be of little applicability or avail.
        But M. Renan assigns to it not less importance than Mr. Wedgwood
        and Mr. Farrar. (See sixth chapter of his ingenious dissertation
        De l&#8217;Origine du Langage, pp. 135-146-148.)</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;L&#8217;imitation, ou l&#8217;onomatop&eacute;e, para&icirc;t avoir
        &eacute;t&eacute; le proc&eacute;d&eacute; ordinaire
        d&#8217;apr&egrave;s lequel les premiers nomenclateurs
        form&egrave;rent les appellations.&#8230; D&#8217;ailleurs, comme le choix
        de l&#8217;appellation n&#8217;est point arbitraire, et que jamais l&#8217;homme
        ne se d&eacute;cide &agrave; assembler des sons au hasard pour
        en faire les signes de la pens&eacute;e, on peut affirmer que de
        tous les mots actuellement usit&eacute;s, il n&#8217;en est pas un
        seul qui <i>n&#8217;ait eu sa raison suffisante</i>, et ne se
        rattache, &agrave; travers mille transformations, &agrave; <i>une
          &eacute;lection primitive</i>. Or, le motif d&eacute;terminant
        pour le choix des mots a d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre, dans la plupart
        des cas, le d&eacute;sir d&#8217;imiter l&#8217;objet qu&#8217;on voulait
        exprimer. L&#8217;instinct de certains animaux suffit pour les porter
        &agrave; ce genre d&#8217;imitation, qui, faute de principes
        rationnels, reste chez eux inf&eacute;cond.&#8230;</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;En r&eacute;sum&eacute;, <i>le caprice</i> n&#8217;a eu aucune part
        dans la formation du langage. Sans doute, on ne peut admettre
        qu&#8217;il y ait une relation intrins&egrave;que entre le nom et la
        chose. Le syst&egrave;me que Platon a si subtilement
        d&eacute;velopp&eacute; dans le Cratyle &#8212; cette th&egrave;se
        qu&#8217;il y a des d&eacute;nominations naturelles, et que la
        propri&eacute;t&eacute; des mots se reconna&icirc;lt &agrave;
        l&#8217;imitation plus ou moins exacte de l&#8217;objet, &#8212; pourrait tout au
        plus s&#8217;appliquer aux noms form&eacute;s par onomatop&eacute;e,
        et pour ceux-ci m&ecirc;mes, la loi dont nous parlous
        n&#8217;&eacute;tablit qu&#8217;une convenance. <i>Les appellations n&#8217;ont
          pas uniquement leur cause dans l&#8217;objet appel&eacute;</i> (sans
        quoi, elles seraient les m&ecirc;mes dans toutes les langues), <i>mais
          dans l&#8217;objet appel&eacute;, vu &agrave; travers les
          dispositions personnelles du sujet appelant</i>.&#8230; La raison
        qui a d&eacute;termin&eacute; le choix des premiers hommes peut
        nous &eacute;chapper; mais elle a exist&eacute;. La liaison du
        sens et du mot n&#8217;est jamais <i>n&eacute;cessaire</i>, jamais <i>arbitraire</i>;
        toujours elle est motiv&eacute;e.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        When M. Renan maintains the Protagorean doctrine, that it is not
        the Object which is cause of the denomination given, but the
        Object seen through the personal dispositions of the
        denominating Subject &#8212; he contradicts the reasoning of the
        Platonic Sokrates in the conversation with Hermogenes (pp.
        386-387; compare 424 A). But he adopts the reasoning of the same
        in the subsequent conversation with Kratylus; wherein the
        relative point of view is introduced for the first time (pp. 429
        A-B, 431 E), and brought more and more into the foreground (pp.
        436 B-D &#8212; 437 C &#8212; 439 C).</p>
      <p>
        The distinction drawn by M. Renan between <i>l&#8217;arbitraire</i>
        and <i>le motiv&eacute;</i> appears to me unfounded: at least,
        it requires a peculiar explanation of the two words &#8212; for if by
        <i>le caprice</i> and <i>l&#8217;arbitraire</i> be meant the
        exclusion of <i>all</i> motive, such a state of mind could not
        be a preliminary to any proceeding at all. M. Renan can only
        mean that the motive which led to the original choice of the
        name, was peculiar to the occasion, and has since been
        forgotten. And this is what he himself says in a note to his
        Preface (pp. 18-19), replying to M. Littr&eacute;: &#8220;L&#8217;Arien
        primitif a eu un motif pour appeler le fr&egrave;re <i>bhratr</i>
        ou <i>fratr</i>, et le S&eacute;mite pour l&#8217;appeler <i>ah</i>:
        peut on dire que cette diff&eacute;rence r&eacute;sulte ou des
        aptitudes diff&eacute;rentes de leur esprit, ou du spectacle
        ext&eacute;rieur? Chaque objet, les circonstances restant les
        m&ecirc;mes, a &eacute;t&eacute; susceptible d&#8217;une foule de
        d&eacute;nominations: le choix qui a &eacute;t&eacute; fait de
        l&#8217;une d&#8217;elles tient &agrave; des causes impossibles &agrave;

        naming with those upon social institutions. Artistic, systematic
        construction &#8212; contrasted with unpremeditated unsystematic
        growth.</span></p>
    <p>
      Respecting social institutions and government, there is one
      well-known theory to which Sir James Mackintosh gave expression in
      the phrase &#8212; &#8220;Governments are not made, but grow&#8221;. The like
      phrase has been applied by an eminent modern author on Logic, to
      language &#8212; &#8220;Languages are not made, but grow&#8221;.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_91" href="#Footnotev3_31_91"><span
          class="sp">91</span></a> One might suppose, in reading the
      second and third books of the Republic of Plato, that Plato also
      had adopted this theory: for the growth of a society, without any
      initiative or predetermined construction by a special individual,
      is there strikingly depicted.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_92"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> But in
      truth it is this theory which stands in most of the Platonic
      works, as the antithesis depreciated and discredited by Plato. The
      view most satisfactory to him contemplates the analogy of a human
      artist or professional man; which he enlarges into the idea of an
      originating, intelligent, artistic, Constructor, as the source of
      all good. This view is exhibited to us in the Tim&aelig;us, where
      we find the Demiurgus, building up by his own fiat all that is
      good in the Kosmos: in the Politikus, where we find the individual
      dictator producing by his uncontrolled ordinance all that is
      really good in the social system; &#8212; lastly, here also in the
      Kratylus, where we have the scientific or artistic <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page328" id="v3page328"></a>328</span>Name-giver,
      and him alone, set forth as competent to construct an assemblage
      of names, each possessing full and perfect rectitude. To this
      theory there is presented a counter-theory, which Plato
      disapproves &#8212; a Kosmos which grows by itself and keeps up its own
      agencies, without any extra-kosmic constructor or superintendent:
      in like manner, an aggregate of social customs, and an aggregate
      of names, which have grown up no one knows how; and which sustain
      and perpetuate themselves by traditional force &#8212; by movement
      already acquired in a given direction. The idea of growth, by
      regular assignable steps and by regularising tendencies
      instinctive and inherent in Nature, belongs rather to Aristotle;
      Plato conceives Nature as herself irregular, and as persuaded or
      constrained into some sort of regularity by a supernatural or
      extranatural artist.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_93"

        M. Destutt de Tracy insists upon the emotional initiative force,
        as deeper and more efficacious than the intellectual, in the
        first formation of language.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Dans l&#8217;origine du langage d&#8217;action, un seul geste dit &#8212; je veux
        cela, ou je vous montre cela, ou je vous demande secours; un
        seul cri dit, je vous appelle, ou je souffre, ou je suis
        content, &amp;c.; mais sans distinguer aucune des id&eacute;es
        qui composent ses propositions. Ce n&#8217;est point par le
        d&eacute;tail, mais par les masses, que, commencent toutes nos
        expressions, ainsi que toutes nos connaissances. Si quelques
        langages poss&egrave;dent des signes propres &agrave; exprimer
        des id&eacute;es isol&eacute;es, ce n&#8217;est donc que par l&#8217;effet
        de la d&eacute;composition qui s&#8217;est op&eacute;r&eacute;e dans
        ces langages; et ces signes, ou noms propres d&#8217;id&eacute;es, ne
        sont, pour ainsi dire, que des d&eacute;bris, des fragmens, ou
        du moins des &eacute;manations de ceux qui d&#8217;abord exprimaient,
        bien ou mal, les propositions tout enti&egrave;res.&#8221; (Destutt de
        Tracy, Grammaire, ch. i. p. 23, ed. 1825; see also the
        Id&eacute;ologie of the same author, ch. xvi. p. 215.)</p>
      <p>
        M. Renan enunciates in the most explicit terms this comparison
        of the formation of language to the growth and development of a
        germ:&#8212; &#8220;Les langues doivent &ecirc;tres compar&eacute;es, non au
        cristal qui se forme par agglom&eacute;ration autour d&#8217;un noyau,
        mais au germe qui se d&eacute;veloppe par sa force intime, et
        par l&#8217;appel n&eacute;cessaire de ses parties&#8221;. (De l&#8217;Origine du
        Langage, ch. iii. p. 101; also ch. iv. pp. 115-117.)</p>
      <p>
        The theory of M. Renan, in this ingenious treatise, is, that
        language is the product of &#8220;la raison spontan&eacute;e, la
        raison populaire,&#8221; without reflexion. &#8220;La reflexion n&#8217;y peut
        rien: les langues sont sorties toutes faites du moule m&ecirc;me
        de l&#8217;esprit humain, comme Minerve du cerveau de Jupiter.&#8221;
        &#8220;Maintenant que la raison r&eacute;fl&eacute;chie a
        remplac&eacute; l&#8217;instinct cr&eacute;ateur, &agrave; peine le
        g&eacute;nie suffit-il pour analyser ce que les l&#8217;esprit des
        premiers hommes enfanta de toutes pi&egrave;ces, et sans y
        songer&#8221; (pp. 98-99). This theory appears to me very doubtful; as
        much as there is proved in it, is stated in a good passage cited
        by M. Renan from Will. von Humboldt (pp. 106-107). But there are
        two remarks to be made, in comparing it with the Kratylus of
        Plato. 1. That the hypothesis of a philosopher &#8220;qui compose un
        langage de sang-froid,&#8221; which appears absurd to Turgot and M.
        Renan (p. 92), did not appear absurd to Plato, but on the
        contrary as the only sure source of what is good and right in
        language. 2. That Plato, in the Kratylus, takes account only of
        <i>naming</i>, and not of the grammatical structure of language,
        which M. Renan considers the essential part (p. 106: compare
        also pp. 208-209). Grammar, with its established analogies, does
        not seem to have been present to Plato&#8217;s mind as an object of
        reflexion; there existed none in his day.</p>

    <p>
      Looking back to the Politikus (reviewed in the last <a
        href="#Platovol3ch30">chapter</a>), <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page329" id="v3page329"></a>329</span>we find Plato
      declaring to us wherein consists the rectitude of a social Form:
      it resides in the presiding and uncontrolled authority of a
      scientific or artistic Ruler, always present and directing every
      one: or of a few such Rulers, if there be a few &#8212; though this is
      more than can be hoped. But such rectitude is seldom or never
      realised. Existing social systems are bad copies of this type,
      degenerating more or less widely from its perfection. One or a Few
      persons arrogate to themselves uncontrolled power, without
      possessing that science or art which justifies the exercise of it
      in the Right Ruler. These are, or may become, extreme
      depravations. The least bad, among all the imperfect systems, is
      an aggregate of fixed laws and magistrates with known functions,
      agreed to by convention of all and faithfully obeyed by all. But
      such a system of fixed laws, though second-best, falls greatly
      short of rectitude. It is much inferior in every way to the
      uncontrolled authority of the scientific Ruler.<a

        See Plato, Politik. pp. 300-301.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      That which Plato does for social systems in the Politikus, he does
      for names in the Kratylus. The full rectitude of names is when
      they are bestowed by the scientific Ruler, considered in the
      capacity of Name-giver. He it is who discerns, and embodies in
      syllables, the true Name-Form in each particular case. But such an
      artist is seldom realised: and there are others who, attempting to
      do his work without his knowledge, perform it ignorantly or under
      false theories.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_95" href="#Footnotev3_31_95"><span
          class="sp">95</span></a> The names thus given are imperfect
      names: moreover, after being given, they become corrupted and
      transformed in passing from man to man. Lastly, the mere fact of
      convention among the individuals composing the society, without
      any deliberate authorship or origination from any Ruler, bad or
      good &#8212; suffices to impart to Names a sort of significance, vulgar
      and imperfect, yet adequate to a certain extent.<a

      <p>
        This unsystematic, spontaneous, origin and growth of language is
        set forth by Lucretius, who declares himself opposed to the
        theory of an originating Name-giver (v. pp. 1021-1060). Jacob
        Grimm and M. Renan espouse a theory, in the main, similar.</p>

    <p>
      It will be seen that in both these cases the Platonic point of <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page330" id="v3page330"></a>330</span>view
      comes out &#8212; deliberate authorship from the scientific or artistic
      individual mind, as the only source of rectitude and perfection.
      But when Plato looks at the reality of life, either in social
      system or in names, he finds no such perfection anywhere: he
      discovers a divine agency originating what is good; but there is
      an independent agency necessary in the way of co-operation, though
      it sometimes counteracts and always debases the good.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_97" href="#Footnotev3_31_97"><span
          class="sp">97</span></a> We find either an incompetent
      dictator who badly imitates the true Artist &#8212; or else we have
      fixed, peremptory, laws; depending on the unsystematic,
      unauthorised, convention among individuals, which has grown up no
      one knows how &#8212; which is transmitted by tradition, being taught by
      every one and learnt by every one without any privileged caste of
      teachers &#8212; and which in the Platonic Protagoras is illustrated in
      the mythe and discourse ascribed to that Sophist;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_98" href="#Footnotev3_31_98"><span
          class="sp">98</span></a> being in truth, common sense, as
      contrasted with professional specialty. In regard to social
      systems, Plato pronounces fixed laws to be the second-best &#8212;
      enjoining strict obedience to them, wherever the first-best cannot
      be obtained. In the Republic he enumerates what are the conditions
      of rectitude in a city: but he admits at the same time that this
      Right Civic Constitution is an ideal, nowhere to be found
      existing: and he points out the successive stages of corruption by
      which it degenerates more and more into conformity with the
      realities of human society. As with Right Civic Constitution, so
      with Right Naming: Plato shows what constitutes rectitude of
      Names, but he admits that this is an ideal seen nowhere, and he
      notes the various causes which deprave the Right Names into that
      imperfect and semi-significant condition, which is the best that
      existing languages present.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_99"

        In the Menon also the same question is broached as in the
        Protagoras, whether virtue is teachable or not? and how any
        virtue can exist, when there are no special teachers, and no
        special learners of virtue? Here we have, though differently
        handled, the same antithesis between the ethical sentiment which
        grows and propagates itself unconsciously, without special
        initiative &#8212; and that which is deliberately prescribed and
        imparted by the wise individual: common sense versus

      false proposition and a false name were impossible: that you could
      not speak the thing that <i>is not</i>, or Non-Ens (&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#8004;&#957;):
      that such a proposition would be an empty sound, without meaning

    </div>

    <p>
      Now this doctrine is dealt with in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,
      Sophist&ecirc;s, and Kratylus. In the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_101" href="#Footnotev3_31_101"><span
          class="sp">101</span></a> Sokrates examines it at great
      length, and proposes several different hypotheses to explain how a
      false proposition might be possible: but ends in pronouncing them
      all inadmissible. He declares himself incompetent, and passes on
      to something else. Again, in the Sophist&ecirc;s, the same point
      is taken up, and discussed there also very copiously.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_31_102" href="#Footnotev3_31_102"><span
          class="sp">102</span></a> The Eleate in that dialogue ends by
      finding a solution which satisfies him (<i>viz.</i>: that &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#951; &#8002;&#957;
      = &#964;&#8056; &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;). But what is remarkable is, that the solution
      does not meet any of the difficulties propounded in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus; nor are those difficulties at all adverted
      to in the Sophist&ecirc;s. Finally, in the Kratylus, we have the
      very same doctrine, that false affirmations are impossible &#8212; which
      both in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and in the Sophist&ecirc;s is
      enunciated, not as the decided opinion of the speaker, but as a
      problem which embarrasses him &#8212; we have this same doctrine averred
      unequivocally by Kratylus as his own full <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page332" id="v3page332"></a>332</span>conviction. And
      Sokrates finds that a very short argument, and a very simple
      comparison, suffice to refute him.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_103"
        href="#Footnotev3_31_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a> The

    <p>
      How are we to explain these three different modes of handling the
      same question by the same philosopher? If the question about
      Non-Ens can be disposed of in the summary way which we read in the
      Kratylus, what is gained by the string of unsolved puzzles in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus &#8212; or by the long discursive argument in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s, ushering in a new solution noway satisfactory?
      If, on the contrary, the difficulties which are unsolved in the
      The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, and imperfectly solved in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s, are real and pertinent &#8212; how are we to explain
      the proceeding of Plato in the Kratylus, when he puts into the
      mouth of Kratylus a distinct averment of the opinion, about
      Non-Ens, yet without allowing him, when it is impugned by
      Sokrates, to urge any of these pertinent arguments in defence of
      it? If the peculiar solution given in the Sophist&ecirc;s be the
      really genuine and triumphant solution, why is it left unnoticed
      both in the Kratylus and the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, and why is it
      contradicted in other dialogues? Which of the three dialogues
      represents Plato&#8217;s real opinion on the question?</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_31_45"
          id="Sidenotev3_31_45"></a>No common didactic purpose pervading
        the Dialogues &#8212; each is a distinct composition, working out its
        own peculiar argument.</span></p>
    <p>
      To these questions, and to many others of like bearing, connected
      with the Platonic writings, I see no satisfactory reply, if we are
      to consider Plato as a positive philosopher, with a scheme and
      edifice of methodised opinions in his mind: and as composing all
      his dialogues with a set purpose, either of inculcating these
      opinions on the reader, or of refuting the opinions opposed to
      them. This supposition is what most Platonic critics have in their
      minds, even when professedly modifying it. Their admiration for
      Plato is not satisfied unless they conceive him in the
      professorial chair as a teacher, surrounded by a crowd of
      learners, all under the obligation (incumbent on learners
      generally) to believe what <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page333" id="v3page333"></a>333</span>they hear.
      Reasoning upon such a basis, the Platonic dialogues present
      themselves to me as a mystery. They exhibit neither identity of
      the teacher, nor identity of the matter taught: the composer (to
      use various Platonic comparisons) is Many, and not One &#8212; he is
      more complex than Typhos.<a name="FnAnchorv3_31_105"

    <p>
      If we are to find any common purpose pervading and binding
      together all the dialogues, it must not be a didactic purpose, in
      the sense above defined. The value of them consists, not in the
      result, but in the discussion &#8212; not in the conclusion, but in the
      premisses for and against it. In this sense all the dialogues have
      value, and all the same sort of value &#8212; though not all equal in
      amount. In different dialogues, the same subject is set before you
      in different ways: with remarks and illustrations sometimes
      tending towards one theory, sometimes towards another. It is for
      you to compare and balance them, and to elicit such result as your
      reason approves. The Platonic dialogues require, in order to
      produce their effect, a supplementary responsive force, and a
      strong effective reaction, from the individual reason of the
      reader: they require moreover that he shall have a genuine
      interest in the process of dialectic scrutiny (&#964;&#8056; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#962;,

      Such manner of proceeding may be judicious or not, according to
      the sentiment of the critic. But it is at any rate Platonic. And
      we have to recall this point of view when dismissing the Kratylus,
      which presents much interest in the premisses and conflicting
      theories, with little or no result. It embodies the oldest
      speculations known to us respecting the origin, the mode of
      signification, and the functions of words as an instrument: and
      not the least interesting part of it, in my judgment, consists in
      its etymological conjectures, affording evidence of a rude
      etymological sense which has now passed away.</p>

      pleasure or enjoyment; and Protarchus his friend advocates the
      same thesis, though in a less peremptory manner. On the contrary,
      Sokrates begins by proclaiming that it consists in wisdom or
      intelligence. He presently however recedes from this doctrine, so
      far as to admit that wisdom, alone and <i>per se</i>, is not
      sufficient to constitute the Supreme Good: and that a certain
      combination of pleasure along with it is required. Though the
      compound total thus formed is superior both to wisdom and to
      pleasure taken separately, yet comparing the two elements of which
      it is compounded, wisdom (Sokrates contends) is the most important
      of the two, and pleasure the least important. Neither wisdom nor
      pleasure can pretend to claim the first prize; but wisdom is fully
      entitled to the second, as being far more cognate than pleasure
      is, with the nature of Good.</p>

        against the Sokratic Elenchus, and the purely negative
        procedure.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such is the general purpose of the dialogue. As to the method of
      enquiry, Plato not only assigns to Sokrates a distinct affirmative
      opinion from the beginning, instead of that profession of
      ignorance which is his more usual characteristic &#8212; but he also
      places in the mouth of Protarchus an explicit protest against the
      negative cross-examination and Elenchus. &#8220;We shall not let you
      off&#8221; (says Protarchus to Sokrates) &#8220;until the two sides of this
      question shall have been so discriminated as to elicit a
      sufficient conclusion. In meeting us on the present question, pray
      desist from that ordinary manner of yours &#8212; desist from throwing
      us into embarrassment, and putting interrogations to which we
      cannot at the moment give suitable answers. We must not be content
      to close the discussion by finding ourselves in one common puzzle
      and confusion. If <i>we</i> cannot solve the difficulty, you must
      solve it for us.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_2" href="#Footnotev3_32_2"><span

    <p>
      Sokrates then remarks that pleasure is very multifarious and
      diverse: and that under that same word, different forms and
      varieties are signified, very unlike to each other, and sometimes
      even opposite to each other. Thus the intemperate man has his
      pleasures, while the temperate man enjoys his pleasures also,
      attached to his own mode of life: so too the simpleton has
      pleasure in his foolish dreams and hopes, the intelligent man in
      the exercise of intellectual force. These and many others are
      varieties of pleasure not resembling, but highly dissimilar, even
      opposite. &#8212; Protarchus replies &#8212; That they proceed from dissimilar
      and opposite circumstances, but that in themselves they are not
      dissimilar or opposite. Pleasure must be completely similar to
      pleasure &#8212; itself to itself. &#8212; So too (rejoins Sokrates) colour is
      like to colour: in that respect there is no difference between
      them. But black colour is different from, and even opposite to,
      white colour.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_5" href="#Footnotev3_32_5"><span
          class="sp">5</span></a> You will go wrong if you make things
      altogether opposite, into one. You may call all pleasures by the
      name <i>pleasures</i>: but you must not affirm between them any
      other point of resemblance, nor call them all <i>good</i>. I
      maintain that some are bad, <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page337" id="v3page337"></a>337</span>others good.
      What common property in all of them, is it, that you signify by
      the name <i>good</i>? As different pleasures are unlike to each
      other, so also different cognitions (or modes of intelligence) are
      unlike to each other; though all of them agree in being <i>cognitions</i>.

    <p>
      In determining between the two competing doctrines &#8212; pleasure on
      one side and intelligence on the other &#8212; Sokrates makes appeal to
      individual choice. &#8220;Would <i>you</i> be satisfied (he asks

      reason, knowledge, and memory &#8212; but having no sense, great or
      small, either of pleasure or pain?&#8221; And Protarchus replies, in
      reference to the joint life of intelligence and pleasure combined,
      &#8220;Every man will choose this joint life in preference to either of
      them separately. It is not one man who will choose it, and another
      who will reject it: but every man will choose it alike.&#8221;<a

      <p>
        Here again in appealing to the individual choice and judgment,
        the Platonic Sokrates indirectly recognises what, in the
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and other dialogues, we have seen him
        formally rejecting and endeavouring to confute &#8212; the Protagorean
        canon or measure. Protarchus is the measure of truth or
        falsehood, of belief or disbelief, to Protarchus himself: every
        other man is so <i>to himself</i>. Sokrates may be a wiser man,
        in the estimation of the public, than Protarchus; and if
        Protarchus believes him to be such, that very belief may amount
        to an authority, determining Protarchus to accept or reject
        various opinions propounded by Sokrates: but the ultimate
        verdict must emanate from the bosom of the acceptor or rejector.
        I have already observed elsewhere, that a large part of the
        conversation which the Platonic dialogues put into the mouth of
        Sokrates, is addressed to individualities and specialties of the
        other interlocutors: that this very power of discriminating
        between one mind and another, forms the great superiority of
        dialectic colloquy as compared with written treatise or
        rhetorical discourse &#8212; both of which address the same terms to a
        multitude of hearers or readers differing among themselves,
        without possibility of separate adaptation to each. (See above,

        Question submitted to Protarchus &#8212; Intense Pleasure, without any
        intelligence &#8212; He declines to accept it.</span></p>
    <p>
      The point, which Sokrates submits to the individual judgment of
      Protarchus, is &#8212; &#8220;Would <i>you</i> be satisfied to pass your life
      in the enjoyment of the most intense pleasures, and would you
      desire nothing farther?&#8221; The reply is in the affirmative. &#8220;But
      recollect (adds Sokrates) that you are to have nothing else. The
      question assumes that you are to be without thought, intelligence,
      reason, sight, and memory: you are neither to have opinion of
      present enjoyment, nor remembrance of past, nor anticipation of
      future: you are to live the life of an oyster, with great present
      pleasure?&#8221; The question being put with these additions, Protarchus
      alters his view, and replies in the negative: at the same time
      expressing his surprise at the strangeness of the hypothesis.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_9" href="#Footnotev3_32_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 21. </p>
      <p>
        Such an hypothesis does indeed depart so totally from the
        conditions of human life, that it cannot be considered as a fair
        test of any doctrine. A perpetuity of delicious sensations
        cannot be enjoyed, consistent with the conditions of animal
        organization. A man cannot realise to himself that which the
        hypothesis promises; much less can he realise it without those
        accompaniments which it assumes him to renounce. The loss stands
        out far more palpably than the gain. It is no refutation of the
        theory of Phil&ecirc;bus; who, announcing pleasure as the Summum
        Bonum, is entitled to call for pleasure in all its varieties,
        and for exemption from all pains. Sokrates himself had
        previously insisted on the great variety as well as on the great
        dissimilarity of the modes of pleasure and pain. To each variety
        of pleasure there corresponds a desire: to each variety of pain,
        an aversion. </p>
      <p>
        If the Summum Bonum is to fulfil the conditions postulated &#8212;
        that is, if it be such as to satisfy all human desires, it ought
        to comprise all these varieties of pleasure. It ought, <i>e.g.</i>,
        to comprise the pleasures of self-esteem, and conscious
        self-protecting power, affording security for the future; it
        ought to comprise exemption from the pains of self-reproach,
        self-contempt, and conscious helplessness. These are among the
        greatest pleasures and pains of the mature man, though they are
        aggregates formed by association. Now the alternative tendered
        by Sokrates neither includes these pleasures nor eliminates
        these pains. It includes only the pleasures of sense; and it is
        tendered to one who has rooted in his mind desires for other
        pleasures, and aversions for other pains, besides those of
        sense. It does not therefore come up to the requirements fairly
        implied in the theory of Phil&ecirc;bus.</p>

        accept a life of Intelligence purely without any pleasure or
        pain? Answer &#8212; <i>No</i>.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates now proceeds to ask Protarchus, whether he will accept a
      life of full and all-comprehensive intelligence purely and simply,
      without any taste either of pleasure or pain. To which Protarchus
      answers, that neither he nor any one else would accept such a
      life.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_10" href="#Footnotev3_32_10"><span

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 21-22. </p>
      <p>
        It is to be remarked, however, that there was more than one
        Grecian philosopher who described the Summum Bonum as consisting
        in absence of pain (&#7936;&#955;&#965;&#960;&#943;&#945;); even without the large measure of
        intelligence which Sokrates here promises, and without any
        positive pleasure. These men would of course have accepted the
        second alternative put by Sokrates, which Protarchus here
        refuses. They took their standard of comparison from the
        actualities of human life around them, which exhibited pain and
        suffering universal, frequent, and unavoidable. They conceived
        that if painlessness could be obtained, it was as much as could
        reasonably be demanded, and that pleasure might be dispensed
        with. In laying down any theory about the Summum Bonum, the
        preliminary question ought always to be settled &#8212; What are the
        conditions of human life which are to be assumed as peremptory
        and unalterable? What circumstances are we at liberty to suppose
        to be suppressed, modified, or reversed? According as these
        fundamental postulates are given in a larger or narrower sense,
        the ideal Summum Bonum will be shaped differently. This
        preliminary requisite to the investigation was little considered
        by the ancient philosophers.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_9"

        difficulties are greatest about Generic Unity &#8212; how it is
        distributed among species and individuals.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates then undertakes to show, that of these two elements,
      intelligence is the most efficacious and the most contributory to
      the Summum Bonum &#8212; pleasure the least so. But as a preparation for
      this enquiry, he adverts to that which has just been agreed
      between them respecting both Pleasure and Intelligence &#8212; That each
      of them is Unum, and each of them at the same time Multa et
      Diversa. Here (argues Sokrates) we find opened before us the
      embarrassing question respecting the One and the Many. Enquirers
      often ask &#8212; &#8220;How can the One be Many? How can the Many be One? How
      can the same thing be both One and Many?&#8221; They find it difficult
      to understand how you, Protarchus, being One person, are called by
      different names &#8212; tall, heavy, white, just, &amp;c.: or how you
      are affirmed to consist of many different parts and members. To
      this difficulty, however (says Sokrates), the reply is easy. You,
      and other particular men, belong to the generated and the
      perishable. You partake of many different Ideas or Essences, and
      your partaking of one among them does not exclude you from
      partaking also of another distinct and even opposite. You partake
      of the Idea or Essence of Unity &#8212; also of Multitude &#8212; of tallness,
      heaviness, whiteness, humanity, greatness, littleness, &amp;c. You
      are both great and little, heavy and light, &amp;c. In regard to
      generated and perishable things, we may understand this. But in
      regard to the ungenerated, imperishable, absolute <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page340" id="v3page340"></a>340</span>Essences,
      the difficulty is more serious. The Self-existent or Universal
      Man, Bull, Animal &#8212; the Self-existent Beautiful, Good &#8212; in regard
      to these Unities or Monads there is room for great controversy.
      First, Do such unities or monads really and truly exist? Next,
      assuming that they do exist, how do they come into communion with
      generated and perishable particulars, infinite in number? Is each
      of them dispersed and parcelled out among countless individuals?
      or is it found, whole and entire, in each individual, maintaining
      itself as one and the same, and yet being parted from itself? Is
      the Universal Man distributed among all individual men, or is he
      one and entire in each of them? How is the Universal Beautiful
      (The Self-Beautiful &#8212; Beauty) in all and each beautiful thing? How
      does this one monad, unchangeable and imperishable, become
      embodied in a multitude of transitory individuals, each
      successively generated and perishing? How does this One become
      Many, or how do these Many become One?<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_11"

      These (says Sokrates) are the really grave difficulties respecting
      the identity of the One and the Many: difficulties which have
      occasioned numerous controversies, and are likely to occasion many
      more. Youthful speculators, especially, are fond of trying their
      first efforts of dialectical ingenuity in arguing upon this
      paradox &#8212; How the One can be Many, and the Many One.<a

      <p>
        In reading the difficulties thus started by Sokrates, we
        perceive them to be the same as those which we have seen set
        forth in the dialogue called Parmenid&ecirc;s, where they are
        put into the mouth of the philosopher so-called; as objections
        requiring to be removed by Sokrates, before the Platonic theory
        of self-existent Ideas, universal, eternal and unchangeable, can
        be admitted. We might expect that Plato having so emphatically
        and repeatedly announced his own sense of the difficulty, would
        proceed to suggest some mode of replying to it. But this he
        never does. In the Parmenid&ecirc;s, he does not even promise
        any explanation; in the Phil&ecirc;bus, he seems to promise one,
        but all the explanation which he gives ignores or jumps over the
        difficulty, enjoining us to proceed as if no such difficulty
        existed.</p>

    <p>
      The mistake commonly made (continues Sokrates) by clever men of
      the present day, is, that they look for nothing beyond the One and
      the Infinite Many: one comprehensive class, and countless
      individuals included in it. They take up carelessly any class
      which strikes them,<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_15"

          name="v3page342" id="v3page342"></a>342</span> of individuals
      under one name. But they never seek for intermediate sub-divisions
      between the two, so as to be able to discriminate one portion of
      the class from other by some definite mark, and thus to constitute
      a sub-class. They do not feel the want of such intermediate
      sub-divisions, nor the necessity of distinguishing one portion of
      this immense group of individuals from another. Yet it is exactly
      upon these discriminating marks that the difference turns, between
      genuine dialectical argument and controversy without result.<a

    <p>
      This general doctrine is illustrated by two particular cases &#8212;
      Speech and Music. The voice (or Vocal Utterance) is One &#8212; the
      voice is also Infinite: to know only thus much is to know very
      little. Even when you know, in addition to this, the general
      distinction of sounds into acute and grave, you are still far
      short of the knowledge of music. You must learn farthermore to
      distinguish all the intermediate gradations, and specific
      varieties of sound, into which the infinity of separate sounds
      admits of being distributed: what and how many these gradations
      are? what are the numerical ratios upon which they depend &#8212; the
      rhythmical and harmonic systems? When you have learnt to know the
      One Genus, the infinite diversity of individual sounds, and the
      number of subordinate specific varieties by which these two
      extremes are connected with each other &#8212; then you know the science
      of music. So too, in speech: when you can distinguish the infinite
      diversity of articulate utterance into vowels, semi-vowels, and
      consonants, each in definite number and with known properties &#8212;
      you are master of grammatical science. You must neither descend at
      once from the One to the Infinite Multitude, nor ascend at once
      from the Infinite Multitude to the One: you must pass through the
      intermediate stages of subordinate Forms, in determinate number.
      All three together make up scientific knowledge. You cannot know
      one portion separately, without knowing the remainder:<span

      all of them being connected into one by the common bond of the

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_15"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_15"></a>Plato&#8217;s explanation does not touch
        the difficulties which he had himself recognised as existing.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such is the explanation which Plato gives as to the identity of
      One and Many. Considered as a reply to his own previous doubts and
      difficulties, it is altogether insufficient. It leaves all those
      doubts unsolved. The first point of enquiry which he had started,
      was, Whether any Universal or Generic Monads really existed: the
      second point was, assuming that they did exist, how each of them,
      being essentially eternal and unchangeable, could so multiply
      itself or divide itself as to be at the same time in an infinite
      variety of particulars.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_18"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Both
      points are left untouched by the explanation. No proof is
      furnished that Universal Monads exist &#8212; still less that they
      multiply or divide their one and unchangeable essence among
      infinite particulars &#8212; least of all is it shown, how such
      multiplication or division can take place, consistently with the
      fundamental and eternal sameness of the Universal Monad. The
      explanation assumes these difficulties to be eliminated, but does
      not suggest the means of eliminating them. The Phil&ecirc;bus,
      like the Parmenid&ecirc;s, recognises the difficulties as
      existing, but leaves them unsolved, though the dogmas to which
      they attach are the cardinal and peculiar tenets of Platonic
      speculation. Plato shows that he is aware of the embarrassments:
      yet he is content to theorize as if they did not exist. In a
      remarkable passage of this very dialogue, he intimates pretty
      clearly that he considered the difficulty of these questions to be
      insuperable, and never likely to be set at rest. This
      identification of the One with the Many, in verbal propositions
      (he says) has begun with the beginning of dialectic debate, and
      will continue to the end of it, as a stimulating puzzle which
      especially captivates the imagination of youth.<a

      <p>
        The sequel (too long to transcribe) of this passage (setting
        forth the manner in which this apparent paradox worked upon the
        imagination of youthful students) is very interesting to read,
        and shows (in my opinion) that Stallbaum&#8217;s interpretation of it
        in his note is not the right one. Plato is here talking (in my
        judgment) about the puzzle and paradox itself: Stallbaum
        represents Plato as talking about his pretended solution of it,
        which has not as yet been at all alluded to. </p>
      <p>
        Plato seems to give his own explanation without full certainty
        or confidence: see p. 16 B. And when we turn to pp. 18-19, we
        shall see that he forgets the original difficulty which had been
        proposed (compare p. 15 B), introducing in place of it another
        totally distinct difficulty, as if <i>that</i> had been in
        contemplation.</p>

    <p>
      But though the difficulties started by Plato remain unexplained,
      still his manner of stating them is in itself valuable and
      instructive. It proclaims &#8212; 1. The necessity of a systematic
      classification, or subordinate scale of species and sub-species,
      between the highest Genus and the group of individuals beneath. 2.
      That each of these subordinate grades in the scale must be founded
      upon some characteristic mark. 3. That the number of sub-divisions
      is definite and assignable, there being a limit beyond which it
      cannot be carried. 4. That full knowledge is not attainable until
      we know all three &#8212; The highest Genus &#8212; The intermediate species
      and sub-species; both what they are, how many there are, and how
      each is characterised &#8212; The infinite group of individuals. These
      three elements must all be known in conjunction: we are not to
      pass either from the first to the third, or from the third to the
      first, except through the second. </p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_17"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_17"></a>At that time little thought had been
        bestowed upon classification as a logical process.</span></p>
    <p>
      The general necessity of systematic classification &#8212; of
      generalisation and specification, or subordination of species and
      sub-species, as a condition of knowing any extensive group of
      individuals &#8212; requires no advocate at the present day. But it was
      otherwise in the time of Plato. There existed then no body of
      knowledge, distributed and classified, to which he could appeal as
      an example. The illustrations to which he himself refers here, of
      language and music as systematic arrangements of vocal sounds,
      were both of them the product of empirical analogy and unconscious
      growth, involving little of predetermined principle or theory. All
      the classification then employed was merely that which is included
      in the structure of language: in the framing of general names,
      each designating a multitude of individuals. All that men knew of
      classification was, that which is involved in calling many
      individuals by the same common name. This is the defect pointed
      out by Plato, when he remarks that <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page345" id="v3page345"></a>345</span>the clever men
      of his time took no heed except of the One and the Infinite (Genus
      and Individuals): neglecting all the intermediate distinctions.
      Upon the knowledge of these <i>media</i> (he says) rests the
      difference between true dialectic debate, and mere polemic.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_20" href="#Footnotev3_32_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> That is &#8212; when you have only an
      infinite multitude of individuals, called by the same generic
      name, it is not even certain that they have a single property in
      common: and even if they have, it is not safe to reason from one
      to another as to the possession of any other property beyond the
      one generic property &#8212; so that the debate ends in mere perplexity.
      All pleasures agree in being pleasures (Sokrates had before
      observed to Protarchus), and all cognitions agree in being
      cognitions. But you cannot from hence infer that there is any
      other property belonging in common to all.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_21" href="#Footnotev3_32_21"><span
          class="sp">21</span></a> That is a point which you cannot
      determine without farther observation of individuals, and
      discrimination of the great multitude into appropriate
      subdivisions. You will thus bring the whole under that triple
      point of view which Plato requires:&#8212; the highest Genus, &#8212; the
      definite number of species and sub-species, &#8212; the undefined number
      of individuals. </p>

        conscious.</span></p>
    <p>
      Here we have set before us one important branch of logical method
      &#8212; the necessity of classification, not simply arising as an
      incidental and unconscious effect of the transitive employment of
      a common name, but undertaken consciously and intentionally as a
      deliberate process, and framed upon principles predetermined as
      essential to the accomplishment of a scientific end. This was a
      conception new in the Sokratic age. Plato seized upon it with
      ardour. He has not only emphatically insisted upon it in the
      Phil&ecirc;bus and elsewhere, but he has also given (in the
      Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus) elaborate examples of systematic
      logical subdivision applied to given subjects.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_19"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_19"></a>Plato&#8217;s doctrine about
        classification is not necessarily connected with his Theory of
        Ideas.</span></p>
    <p>
      We may here remark that Plato&#8217;s views as to the necessity of
      systematic classification, or of connecting the Summum Genus with
      individuals by intermediate stages of gradually decreasing
      generality &#8212; are not necessarily <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page346" id="v3page346"></a>346</span>connected with
      his peculiar theory of Ideas as Self-existent objects, eternal and
      unchangeable. The two are indeed blended together in his own mind
      and language: but the one is quite separable from the other; and
      his remarks on classification are more perspicuous without his
      theory of Ideas than with it. Classification does not depend upon
      his hypothesis &#8212; That Ideas are not simply Concepts of the Reason,
      but absolute existences apart from the Reason (Entia Rationis
      apart from the Ratio) &#8212; and that these Ideas correspond to the
      words <i>Unum</i>, <i>Multa definit&eacute;</i>, <i>Multa
        indefinit&eacute;</i>, which are put together to compose the
      totality of what we see and feel in the Kosmos.</p>
    <p>
      Applying this general doctrine (about the necessity of
      establishing subordinate classes as intermediate between the Genus
      and Individuals) to the particular subject debated between
      Sokrates and Protarchus &#8212; the next step in the procedure would
      naturally be, to distinguish the subordinate classes comprised
      first under the Genus Pleasure &#8212; next, under the Genus
      Intelligence (or Cognition). And so indeed the dialogue seems to
      promise<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_22" href="#Footnotev3_32_22"><span
          class="sp">22</span></a> in tolerably explicit terms.</p>

        two former. 4. Combining Cause or Agency.</span></p>
    <p>
      But such promise is not realised. The dialogue takes a different
      turn, and recurs to the general distinction already brought to
      view between the Finient (Determinans) and the Infinite
      (Indeterminatum). We have it laid down that all existences in the
      universe are divided into four Genera: 1. The Infinite or
      Indeterminate. 2. The Finient or the Determinans. 3. The product
      of these two, mixed or compounded together Determinatum. 4. The
      Cause or Agency whereby they become mixed together. &#8212; Of these
      four, the first is a Genus, or is both One and Many, having
      numerous varieties, all agreeing in the possession of a perpetual
      More and Less (without any limit or positive quantity): that which
      is perpetually increasing or diminishing, more or less hot, cold,
      moist, great, &amp;c., than any given positive standard. The
      second, or the Determinans, is also a Genus, or One and Many:
      including equal, double, triple, and all fixed ratios.<a

    <p>The third Genus is laid down by Plato as generated by a mixture
      or combination of these two first &#8212; the Infinite and the
      Determinans. The varieties of this third or compound Genus
      comprise all that is good and desirable in nature &#8212; health,
      strength, beauty, virtue, fine weather, good temperature:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_24" href="#Footnotev3_32_24"><span
          class="sp">24</span></a> all agreeing, each in its respective

    </div>

    <p>
      Fourthly, Plato assumes a distinct element of causal agency which
      operates such mixture of the Determinans with the Infinite, or
      banishment and supersession of the latter by the former.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_21"

        first of these four Classes &#8212; Cognition or Intelligence belongs

    <p>
      We now approach the application of these generalities to the
      question in hand &#8212; the comparative estimate of pleasure and
      intelligence in reference to Good. It has been granted that
      neither of them separately is sufficient, and that both must be
      combined to compose the result Good: but the question remains,
      which of the two elements is the most important in the compound?
      To which of the four above-mentioned Genera (says Sokrates) does
      Pleasure belong? It belongs to the Infinite or Indeterminate: so
      also does Pain. To which of the four does Intelligence or
      Cognition belong? It belongs to the fourth, or to the nature of
      Cause, the productive agency whereby definite combinations are
      brought about.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_25" href="#Footnotev3_32_25"><span

    <p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_22"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_22"></a>In the combination, essential to
        Good, of Intelligence with Pleasure, Intelligence is the more
        important of the two constituents.</span></p>
    <p>
      Hence we see (Sokrates argues) that pleasure is a less important
      element than Intelligence, in the compound called Good. For
      pleasure belongs to the Infinite: but pain belongs to the Infinite
      also: the Infinite therefore, being common to both, cannot be the
      circumstance which imparts to pleasures their affinity with Good:
      they must derive that affinity from some one of the other
      elements.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_26" href="#Footnotev3_32_26"><span
          class="sp">26</span></a> It is Intelligence which imparts to
      pleasures their affinity with Good: for Intelligence belongs to
      the more efficacious Genus called Cause. In the combination of
      Intelligence with Pleasure, indispensable to constitute Good,
      Intelligence is the primary <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page348" id="v3page348"></a>348</span>element,
      Pleasure only the secondary element. Intelligence or Reason is the
      ruling cause which pervades and directs both the smaller body
      called Man, and the greater body called the Kosmos. The body of
      man consists of a combination of the four elements, Earth, Water,
      Air, and Fire: deriving its supply of all these elements from the
      vast stock of them which constitutes the Kosmos. So too the mind
      of man, with its limited reason and intelligence, is derived from
      the vast stock of mind, reason, and intelligence, diffused
      throughout the Kosmos, and governing its great elemental body. The
      Kosmos is animated and intelligent, having body and mind like man,
      but in far higher measure and perfection. It is from this source
      alone that man can derive his supply of mind and intelligence.<a

      out of that union (of the Infinite with the Determinans or
      Finient) which includes all animated bodies. Health and Harmony
      reside in these animated bodies: and pleasure as well as pain
      proceed from modifications of such fundamental harmony. When the
      fundamental harmony is disturbed or dissolved, pain is the
      consequence: when the disturbance is rectified and the harmony
      restored, pleasure <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page349"

      hunger, thirst, extreme heat and cold, are painful, because they

    <p>
      This is the primary conception, or original class, of pleasures
      and pains, embracing body and mind in one and the same fact.
      Pleasure cannot be had without antecedent pain: it is in fact a

    <p>
      Those pleasures, which reside in the mind alone without the body,
      arise through memory and by means of reminiscence. When the body
      receives a shock which does not go through to the mind, we call
      the fact insensibility. In sensation, the body and mind are both
      affected:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_35" href="#Footnotev3_32_35"><span
          class="sp">35</span></a> such sensation is treasured up in the
      memory, and the mental part of it is recalled (without the bodily
      part) by reminiscence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_36"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Memory
      and reminiscence are the foundations of desire or appetite. When
      the body suffers the pain of hunger or thirst, the mind recollects
      previous moments of satisfaction, desires a repetition of that
      satisfaction by means of food or drink. Here the body and the mind
      are not moved in the same way, but in two opposite ways: the
      desire belongs to the mind alone, and is turned towards something
      directly opposed to the affection of the body. That which the body
      feels is emptiness: that which the mind feels is desire of
      replenishment, or of the condition opposed to emptiness. But it is
      only after experience of replenishment that the mind will feel
      such desire. On the first occasion of emptiness, it will not
      desire replenishment, because it will have nothing, neither
      sensation nor memory, through which to touch replenishment: it can
      only do so after replenishment has been previously enjoyed, and
      through the memory. Desire therefore is a state of the mind apart
      from the body, resting upon memory.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_37"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Here
      then the man is in a double state: the pain of emptiness, which
      affects the mind through the body, and the memory of past
      replenishment, or expectation of future replenishment, which
      resides in the mind. Such expectation, if certain and immediate,
      will be a state of pleasure: if doubtful and distant, it will be a
      state of pain. The state of emptiness and consequent appetite must
      be, at the very best, a state of mixed pain and pleasure: and it
      may <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page351" id="v3page351"></a>351</span>perhaps
      be a state of pain only, under two distinct forms.<a

      <p>
        This analysis of desire is in the main just: antecedent to all
        gratification, it is simple uneasiness: gratification having
        been supplied, the memory thereof remains, and goes along with
        the uneasiness to form the complex mental state called <i>desire</i>.</p>
      <p>
        But there is another case of desire. While tasting a pleasure,
        we desire the continuance of it: and if the expectation of its
        continuance be assured, this is an additional pleasure: two
        sources of pleasure instead of one. In this last case, there is
        no such conjunction of opposite states, pain and pleasure, as
        Plato pointed out in the former case.</p>

        Sokrates maintains that they are so.</span></p>
    <p>
      What do you mean (asks Protarchus) by true pleasures or pains? How
      can pleasures or pains be either true or false? Opinions and
      expectations may be true or false; but not pleasures, nor pains. </p>
    <p>
      That is an important question (replies Sokrates), which we must
      carefully examine. If opinions may be false or true, surely
      pleasures may be so likewise. When a man holds an opinion, there
      is always some Object of his opinion, whether he thinks truly or
      falsely: so also when a man takes delight, there must always be
      some Object in which he takes delight, truly or falsely. Pleasure
      and pain, as well as opinion, are susceptible of various
      attributes; vehement or moderate, right or wrong, bad or good.
      Delight sometimes comes to us along with a false opinion,
      sometimes along with a true one.</p>
    <p>
      Yes (replies Protarchus), but we then call <i>the opinion</i>
      true or false &#8212; not <i>the pleasure</i>.<a

      You will not deny (says Sokrates) that there is a difference
      between the pleasure accompanying a true opinion, and that which
      accompanies a false opinion. Wherein does the difference consist?
      Our opinions, and our comparisons of opinion, arise from sensation
      and memory:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_40" href="#Footnotev3_32_40"><span
          class="sp">40</span></a> which write words and impress images
      upon our mind (as upon a book or canvas), sometimes truly,
      sometimes falsely,<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_41"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> not only
      respecting <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page352"
          id="v3page352"></a>352</span>the past and present, but also
      respecting the future. To these opinions respecting the future are
      attached the pleasures and pains of expectation, which we have
      already recognised as belonging to the mind alone, &#8212; anticipations
      of bodily pleasures or pains to come &#8212; hopes and fears. As our
      opinions respecting the future are sometimes true, sometimes
      false, so also are our hopes and fears: but throughout our lives
      we are always full of hopes and fears.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_42"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> Now the
      just and good man, being a favourite of the Gods, will have these
      visions or anticipations of the future presented to him truly and
      accurately: the bad man on the contrary will have them presented
      to him falsely. The pleasures of anticipation will be true to the
      former, and false to the latter:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_43"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> his
      false pleasures will be a ludicrous parody on the true ones.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_44" href="#Footnotev3_32_44"><span
          class="sp">44</span></a> Good or bad opinions are identical
      with true or false opinions: so also are good or bad pleasures,
      identical with true or false pleasures: there is no other ground
      for their being good or bad.</p>

      <p>
        It seems odd that Plato here puts the painter <i>after</i> the
        scribe, and not <i>before</i> him. The images or phantasm of
        sense must be painted on the mind before any words are written
        upon it if we are to adopt both these metaphors).</p>
      <p>
        The comparison of the mind to a sheet of paper or a book begins
        with the poets (&AElig;schyl. Prometh. 790), and passes into
        philosophy with Plato.</p>

      I admit this identity (remarks Protarchus) in regard to opinions,

    <p>
      We agreed before that the state, called Appetite or Desire, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page353" id="v3page353"></a>353</span>was
      a mixed state comprehending body and mind: the state of body
      affecting the mind with a pain of emptiness, &#8212; the state of mind
      apart from body being either a pleasure of expected replenishment,
      or a pain arising from our regarding replenishment as distant or
      unattainable. Appetite or Desire, therefore, is sometimes mixed
      pleasure and pain; both, of the genus Infinite, Indeterminate. We
      desire to compare these pleasures and pains, and to value their
      magnitude in relation to each other, but we have no means of
      performing the process. We not only cannot perform it well, but we
      are sure to perform it wrongly. For future pleasure or pain counts
      for more or less in our comparison, according to its proximity or
      distance. Here then is a constant source of false computation:
      pleasures and pains counted as greater or less than they really
      are: in other words, false pleasures and pains. We thus see that
      pleasures may be true or false, no less than opinions.<a

    <p>
      We have also other ways of proving the point that much of what is

      no pleasure at all, or pleasure mingled and alloyed with pain and

      pleasure &#8212; that pain arises from derangement of the harmony of our
      nature, and pleasure from the correction of such derangement, or
      from the re-establishment of harmony &#8212; there may be and are states
      which are neither painful nor pleasurable. Doubtless the body
      never remains the same: it is always undergoing change: but the
      gentle and gradual changes (such as growth, &amp;c.) escape our
      consciousness, producing neither pain nor pleasure: none but the
      marked, sudden changes force themselves upon our consciousness,

        philosophers &#8212; That pleasure is no reality, but a mere juggle &#8212;
        no reality except pain, and the relief from pain.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now there are some philosophers who confound this distinction:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_51" href="#Footnotev3_32_51"><span
          class="sp">51</span></a> Philosophers respectable, but stern,
      who hate the very name of pleasure, deny its existence as a
      separate state <i>per se</i>, and maintain it to be nothing more
      than relief from pain: implying therefore, perpetually and
      inevitably, the conjunction or antecedence of pain. They consider
      the seduction of pleasure in prospect to be a mere juggle &#8212; a
      promise never realised. Often the expected moment brings no
      pleasure at all: and even when it does, there are constant
      accompaniments of pain, which always greatly impair, often
      countervail, sometimes far more than countervail, its effect. Pain
      is regarded by them as the evil &#8212; removal or mitigation of pain as
      the good &#8212; of human life.</p>

        but not wholly.</span></p>
    <p>
      These philosophers (continues Sokrates) are like prophets who
      speak truth from the stimulus of internal temperament, without any
      rational comprehension of it. Their theory is partially true, but
      not universally.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_52"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> It is
      true of a large portion of what are called pleasures, but it is
      not true of all pleasures. Most pleasures (indeed all the more
      vehement and coveted pleasures), correspond to the description
      given in the theory. The moment when the supposed intense pleasure
      arrives, is a disappointment of the antecedent hopes, either by
      not bringing the pleasure promised, or by bringing it along with a
      preponderant dose of pain. But there are some pleasures of which
      this cannot be said &#8212; which are really true and unmixed with pain.
      Which these are (continues Sokrates), I will presently explain:
      but I shall first state the case of the pleasure-hating
      philosophers, so far as I go along with it.</p>

        must learn what pleasure is by looking at the intense pleasures
        &#8212; These are connected with distempered body and mind.</span></p>
    <p>
      When we are studying any property (they say), we ought to examine
      especially those cases in which it appears most fully and
      prominently developed: thus, if we are enquiring into hardness, we
      must take for our first objects of investigation the hardest
      things, in preference to those which are less hard or scarcely
      hard at all.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_53" href="#Footnotev3_32_53"><span
          class="sp">53</span></a> So in enquiring into pleasure
      generally, we must investigate first the pleasures of extreme
      intensity and vehemence. Now the most intense pleasures are
      enjoyed not in a healthy state of body, but on the contrary under
      circumstances of distemper and disorder: because they are then
      preceded by the most violent wants and desires. The sick man under
      fever suffers greater thirst and cold than when he is in health,
      but in the satisfaction of those wants, his pleasure is
      proportionally more intense. Again when he suffers from the itch
      or an inflamed state of body, the pleasure of rubbing or
      scratching is more intense than if he had no such disorder.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_54" href="#Footnotev3_32_54"><span
          class="sp">54</span></a> The most vehement bodily pleasures
      can only be enjoyed under condition of being preceded or attended
      by pains greater or less as the case may be. The condition is not
      one of pure pleasure, but mixed between pain and pleasure.
      Sometimes the pain preponderates, sometimes the pleasure: if the
      latter, then most men, forgetting the accompanying pain, look upon
      these transient moments as the summit of happiness.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_55" href="#Footnotev3_32_55"><span
          class="sp">55</span></a> In like manner the violent and insane
      man, under the stimulus of furious passions and desires,
      experiences more intense gratifications than persons of sober
      disposition: his condition is a mixed one, of great pains and
      great pleasures. The like is true of all the vehement passions &#8212;
      love, hatred, revenge, anger, jealousy, envy, fear, sorrow,
      &amp;c.: all of them embody pleasures mixed with pain, and the
      magnitude of the pleasure is proportioned to that of the
      accompanying pain.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_56"

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 49-50 D. Plato here introduces, at
        some length, an analysis of the mixed sentiment of pleasure and
        pain with which we regard scenic representations, tragedy and
        comedy &#8212; especially the latter. The explanation which he gives
        of the sentiment of the ludicrous is curious, and is intended to
        elucidate an obscure psychological phenomenon (&#8005;&#963;&#8179; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;
        &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, p. 48 B). But his explanation is not clear, and the sense
        which he gives to the word &#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962; is a forced one. He states
        truly that the natural object (at least one among the objects)
        which a man laughs at, is the intellectual and moral infirmities
        of persons with whom he is in friendly intercourse, when such
        persons are not placed in a situation of power, so as to make
        their defects or displeasure pregnant with dangerous
        consequences. The laugher is amused with exaggerated
        self-estimation or foolish vanity displayed by friends,
        &#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;, &#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#945; &amp;c. (49 E). But how the laugher can be
        said to experience a mixture of pain and pleasure here, or how
        he can be said to feel &#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;, I do not clearly see. At least
        &#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962; is here used in the very unusual sense (to use
        Stallbaum&#8217;s words, note p. 48 B, page 278) of &#8220;injusta
        l&aelig;titia de malis eorum, quibus bene cupere debemus&#8221;: a
        sense altogether contrary to that which the word bears in Xen.
        Memor. iii. 9, 8; which Stallbaum himself cites, as if the
        definition of &#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962; were the same in both.</p>

    <p>
      Recollect (observes Sokrates) that the question here is not
      whether <i>more pleasure</i> is enjoyed, <i>on the whole</i>, in
      a state of health than in a state of sickness &#8212; by violent rather
      than by sober men. The question is, about the intense modes of
      pleasure. Respecting these, I have endeavoured to show that they
      belong to a distempered, rather than to a healthy, state both of
      state of body and mind:&#8212; and that they cannot be enjoyed pure,
      without a countervailing or preponderant accompaniment of pain.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_57" href="#Footnotev3_32_57"><span
          class="sp">57</span></a> This is equally true, whether they be
      pleasures of body alone, of mind alone, or of body and mind
      together. They are false and delusive pleasures: in fact, they are
      pleasures only in seeming, but not in truth and reality. To-morrow
      I will give you fuller proofs on the subject.<a

      Thus far (continues Sokrates) I have set forth the case on behalf
      of the pleasure-haters. Though I deny their full doctrine, &#8212; that
      there is no pleasure except cessation from pain &#8212; I nevertheless
      agree with them and cite them as witnesses on my behalf, to the
      extent of affirming that a large proportion of our so-called

      colours and figures &#8212; by many <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page357" id="v3page357"></a>357</span>odours &#8212; by
      various sounds: none of which are preceded by any painful want
      requiring to be satisfied. The sensation when it comes is
      therefore one of pure and unmixed pleasure. The figures here meant
      are the perfect triangle, cube, circle, &amp;c.: the colours and
      sounds are such as are clear and simple. All these are beautiful
      and pleasurable absolutely and in themselves &#8212; not simply in
      relation to (or relatively to) some special antecedent condition.
      Smells too, though less divine than the others, are in common with
      them unalloyed by accompanying pain.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_60"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> To these
      must be added the pleasure of acquiring knowledge, which supposes
      neither any painful want before it, nor any subsequent pain even
      if the knowledge acquired be lost. This too is one of the unmixed
      or pure pleasures; though it is not attainable by most men, but
      only by a select few.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_61"

    <p>
      Having thus distinguished the pure and moderate class of
      pleasures, from the mixed and vehement &#8212; we may remark that the
      former class admit of measure and proportion, while the latter
      belong to the immeasurable and the infinite. Moreover, look where
      we will, we shall find truth on the side of the select, small,
      unmixed specimens &#8212; rather than among the large and mixed masses.
      A small patch of white colour, free from all trace of any other
      colour, is truer, purer, and more beautiful, than a large mass of
      clouded and troubled white. In like manner, gentle pleasure, free
      from all pain, is more pleasurable, truer, and more beautiful,
      than intense pleasure coupled with pain.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_62"

        substance or essence: it cannot therefore be an End, because all
        generation is only a means towards substance &#8212; Pleasure
        therefore cannot be the Good.</span></p>
    <p>
      There are yet other arguments remaining (continues Sokrates) which
      show that pleasure cannot be the Summum Bonum. If it be so, it
      must be an End, not a Means: it must be something for the sake of
      which other things exist or are done &#8212; not something which itself
      exists or is done for the sake of something else. But pleasure is
      not an End: it is essentially a means, as we may infer from the
      reasonings of its own advocates. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page358" id="v3page358"></a>358</span>They themselves
      tell us that it is generation, not substance:&#8212; essentially a
      process of transition or change, never attaining essence or
      permanence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_63" href="#Footnotev3_32_63"><span
          class="sp">63</span></a> But generation or transition is
      always for the sake of the thing to be generated, or for Substance
      &#8212; not substance for the sake of generation: the transitory serves
      as a road to the permanent, not <i>vice vers&agrave;</i>.
      Pleasure is thus a means, not an End. It cannot therefore partake
      of the essential nature and dignity of Good: it belongs to a
      subordinate and imperfect category.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_64"

      Indeed we cannot reasonably admit that there is no Good in bodies

      nor that, within the mind, pleasure alone is good, while courage,
      temperance, &amp;c., are not good:&#8212; nor that a man is good only

        the varieties of Knowledge or Intelligence. Some are more true
        and exact than others, according as they admit more or less of
        measuring and computation.</span></p>
    <p>
      Having thus (continues Sokrates) gone through the analysis of
      pleasures, distinguishing such as are true and pure, from such as
      are false and troubled &#8212; we must apply the like distinctive
      analysis to the various modes of knowledge and intelligence. Which
      varieties of knowledge, science, or art, are the purest from
      heterogeneous elements, and bear most closely upon truth? Some
      sciences and arts (we know) are intended for special professional
      practice: others are taught as subjects for improving the
      intellect of youth. As specimens of the former variety, we may
      notice music, medicine, husbandry, navigation, generalship,
      joinery, ship-building, &amp;c. Now in all these, the guiding and
      directing elements are computation, mensuration, and statics &#8212; the
      sciences or arts of computing, measuring, weighing. Take away
      these three &#8212; and little would be left worth having, in any <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page359" id="v3page359"></a>359</span>of
      the sciences or arts before named. There would be no exact
      assignable rules, no definite proportions: everything would be
      left to vague conjecture, depending upon each artisan&#8217;s knack and
      practice which some erroneously call Art. In proportion as each of
      these professional occupations has in it more or less of
      computation and mensuration, in the same proportion is it exact
      and true. There is little of computation or mensuration in music,
      medicine, husbandry, &amp;c.: there is more of them in joinery and
      ship-building, which employ the line, plummet, and other
      instruments: accordingly these latter are more true and exact,
      less dependent upon knack and conjecture, than the three former.<a

    <p>
      But a farther distinction must here be taken (Sokrates goes on).
      Even in such practical arts as ship-building, which include most
      of computation and mensuration &#8212; these two latter do not appear
      pure, but diversified and embodied in a multitude of variable
      particulars. Arithmetic and geometry, as applied by the

        of all Cognitions. Analogy between Cognition and Pleasure: in
        each, there are gradations of truth and purity.</span></p>
    <p>
      We thus make out (continues Sokrates) that there is a difference
      between one variety and another variety of science or knowledge,
      analogous to that which we have traced between the varieties of
      pleasure. One pleasure is true and pure; another is not so, or is
      inseparably connected with pain and non-pleasurable elements &#8212;
      there being in each case a difference in degree. So too one
      variety of science, cognition, or art, is more true and pure than
      another: that is, it is less intermingled with fluctuating
      particulars and indefinite accompaniments. A science, bearing one
      and the same name, is different according as it is handled by the
      practical man or by the philosopher. Only as handled by the
      philosopher, does science attain purity: dealing with eternal and
      invariable essences. Among all sciences, Dialectic is the truest
      and purest, because it takes comprehensive cognizance of the
      eternal and invariable &#8212; <i>Ens semper Idem</i> &#8212; presiding over
      those subordinate sciences which bear upon the like matter in
      partial and separate departments.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_70"

        superiority for Rhetoric. Sokrates admits that Rhetoric is
        superior in usefulness and celebrity: but he claims superiority
        for Dialectic, as satisfying the lover of truth.</span></p>
    <p>
      Your opinion (remarks Protarchus) does not agree with that of
      Gorgias. He affirms, that the power of persuasion (Rhetoric) is
      the greatest and best of all arts: inasmuch as it enables us to
      carry all our points, not by force, but with the free will and
      consent of others. I should be glad to avoid contradicting either
      him or you.</p>
    <p>
      There is no real contradiction between us (replies Sokrates). You
      may concede to Gorgias that his art or cognition is the greatest
      and best of all &#8212; the most in repute, as well as the most useful
      to mankind. I do not claim any superiority of <i>that</i> kind,
      on behalf of my cognition.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_71"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> I claim
      for it superiority in truth and purity. I remarked before, that a
      small patch of unmixed white colour was superior in truth and

      gentle and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page361"
          id="v3page361"></a>361</span>unmixed pleasure, in like manner,
      to one that is more intense but alloyed with pains. It is this
      superiority that I assert for Dialectic and the other sister
      cognitions. They are of little positive advantage to mankind: yet
      they, and only they, will satisfy both the demands of
      intelligence, and the impulse within us, in so far as we have an
      impulse to love and strain after truth.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_72"

    <p>
      You must see (rejoins Sokrates) that Rhetoric, and most other arts
      or sciences, employ all their study, and seek all their standard,
      in opinions alone: while of those who study Nature, the greater
      number confine their investigations to this Kosmos, to its

        nor Pleasure separately, is the Good, but a mixture of the two &#8212;
        Intelligence being the most important. How are they to be mixed?</span></p>
    <p>
      We have now (continues Sokrates) examined pleasure separately and
      intelligence separately. We have agreed that neither of them,
      apart and by itself, comes up to the conception of Good; the
      attribute of which is, to be all sufficient, and to give plenary
      satisfaction, so that any animal possessing it desires nothing
      besides.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_75" href="#Footnotev3_32_75"><span
          class="sp">75</span></a> We must therefore seek Good in a
      certain mixture or combination of the two &#8212; Pleasure and
      Intelligence: and we must determine, what sort of combination of

      with all cognitions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page362"
          id="v3page362"></a>362</span> at once and indiscriminately,
      will hardly be safe. We will first mix the truest and purest
      pleasures (those which include pleasure in its purest form), with
      the truest or purest cognitions (those which deal altogether with
      eternal and unchangeable essence, not with fluctuating
      particulars). Will such a combination suffice to constitute Good,
      or an all-sufficient and all-satisfactory existence? Or do we want
      anything more besides?<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_76"

      That would be a ludicrous position indeed (remarks Protarchus), to
      have his mind full of the divine Ideas or cognitions only.</p>
    <p>
      What! (replies Sokrates) must he have cognition not only of the
      true line and circle, but also of the false, the variable, the
      uncertain?</p>
    <p>
      Certainly (says Protarchus), we all must have this farther
      cognition, if we are to find our way from hence to our own homes.<a

    <p>
      Must we then admit (says Sokrates) those cognitions also in music,
      which we declared to be full of conjecture and imitation, without
      any pure truth or certainty?</p>
    <p>
      We must admit them (says Protarchus), if life is to be worth
      anything at all. No harm can come from admitting all the other
      cognitions, provided a man possesses the first and most perfect.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_49"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_49"></a>But we must include no pleasures
        except the true, pure, and necessary. The others are not
        compatible with Cognition or Intelligence &#8212; especially the
        intense sexual pleasures.</span></p>
    <p>
      Well then (continues Sokrates), we will admit them all. We have
      now to consider whether we can in like manner admit all pleasures
      without distinction. The true and pure must first be let in: next,
      such as are <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page363"
          id="v3page363"></a>363</span>necessary and indispensable: and
      all the rest also, if any one can show that there is advantage
      without mischief in our enjoying every variety of pleasure.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_80" href="#Footnotev3_32_80"><span
          class="sp">80</span></a> We must put the question first to
      pleasures, next to cognitions &#8212; whether they can consent
      respectively to live in company with each other. Now pleasures
      will readily consent to the companionship of cognitions: but
      cognitions (or Reason, upon whom they depend) will not tolerate
      the companionship of all pleasures indiscriminately. Reason will
      welcome the true and pure pleasures: she will also accept such as
      are indispensable, and such as consist with health, and with a
      sober and virtuous disposition. But Reason will not tolerate those
      most intense, violent, insane, pleasures, which extinguish correct
      memory, disturb sound reflection, and consist only with folly and
      bad conduct. Excluding these violent pleasures, but retaining the
      others in company with Reason and Truth &#8212; we shall secure that
      perfect and harmonious mixture which makes the nearest
      approximation to Good.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_81"

        mixture? It is Measure, Proportion, Symmetry. To these Reason is
        more akin than Pleasure.</span></p>
    <p>
      This mixture as Good (continues Sokrates) will be acceptable to
      all.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_82" href="#Footnotev3_32_82"><span
          class="sp">82</span></a> But what is the cause that it is so?
      and is that cause more akin to Reason or to Pleasure? The answer
      is, that this mixture and combination, like every other that is
      excellent, derives its excellence from Measure and Proportion.
      Thus the Good becomes merged in the Beautiful: for measure and
      proportion (Moderation and Symmetry) constitute in every case
      beauty and excellence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_83"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> In this
      case, Truth has been recognised as a third element of the mixture:
      the three together coalesce into Good, forming a Quasi-Unum, which
      serves instead of a Real Unum or Idea of Good.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_84" href="#Footnotev3_32_84"><span

          name="v3page364" id="v3page364"></a>364</span>must examine
      these three elements separately &#8212; Truth &#8212; Moderation &#8212; Symmetry
      (Measure &#8212; Proportion) to find whether each of them is most akin
      to Reason or to Pleasure. There can be no doubt that to all the
      three, Reason is more akin than Pleasure: and that the intense
      pleasures are in strong repugnance and antipathy to all the three.<a

    <p>
      We thus see (says Sokrates in conclusion), in reference to the

      second in the scale of approximation to Good. First comes Measure
      &#8212; the Moderate &#8212; the Seasonable &#8212; and all those eternal Forms and

      Intelligence. Fourthly, the various sciences, cognitions, arts,
      and right opinions &#8212; acquirements embodied in the mind itself.
      Fifthly, those pleasures which we have discriminated as pure
      pleasures without admixture of pain; belonging to the mind itself
      but consequent on the sensations of sight, hearing, smell.<a

      It is not necessary to trace the descending scale farther. It has
      been shown, against Phil&ecirc;bus &#8212; That though neither
      Intelligence separately, nor Pleasure separately, is an adequate
      embodiment of Good, which requires both of them conjointly &#8212; yet
      Intelligence is more akin to Good, and stands nearer to it in
      nature, than Pleasure.</p>

      Dionysius of Halikarnassus, while blaming the highflown metaphor
      and poetry of the Ph&aelig;drus and other Platonic dialogues,
      speaks with great admiration of Plato in his appropriate walk of
      the Sokratic dialogues; and selects specially the Phil&ecirc;bus,
      as his example of these latter. I confess that this selection <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page365" id="v3page365"></a>365</span>surprises
      me: for the Phil&ecirc;bus, while it explicitly renounces the
      peculiar Sokratic vein, and becomes didactic &#8212; cannot be said to
      possess high merit as a didactic composition. It is neither clear,
      nor orderly, nor comparable in animation to the expository books
      of the Republic.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_89"

          id="Sidenotev3_32_52"></a>Remarks. Sokrates does not claim for
        Good the unity of an Idea, but a quasi-unity of analogy.</span></p>
    <p>
      Sokrates concludes his task, in the debate with Protarchus, by
      describing Bonum or the Supreme Good as a complex aggregate of
      five distinct elements, in a graduated scale of affinity to it and
      contributing to its composition in a greater or less degree
      according to the order in which they are placed. Plato does not
      intimate that these five complete the catalogue; but that after
      the fifth degree, the affinity becomes too feeble to deserve
      notice.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_90" href="#Footnotev3_32_90"><span
          class="sp">90</span></a> According to this view, no Idea of
      Good, in the strict Platonic sense, is affirmed. Good has not the
      complete unity of an Idea, but only the quasi-unity of analogy
      between its diverse elements; which are attached by different
      threads to the same root, with an order of priority and
      posteriority.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_91" href="#Footnotev3_32_91"><span

        Extreme absolute view, maintained by Eukleides: extreme relative
        by the Xenophontic Sokrates. Plato here blends the two in part;
        an Eclectic doctrine.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the discussions about Bonum, there existed among the
      contemporaries of Plato a great divergence of opinions. Eukleides
      of Megara represents the extreme absolute, ontological, or
      objective view: Sokrates (I mean the historical Sokrates, as
      reported by Xenophon) enunciated very distinctly the relative or
      subjective view. &#8220;Good (said Eukleides) is the One: the only real,
      eternal, omnipresent Ens &#8212; always the same or like <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page366" id="v3page366"></a>366</span>itself
      &#8212; called sometimes Good, sometimes Intelligence, and by various
      other names: the opposite of Good has no real existence, but only
      a temporary, phenomenal, relative, existence.&#8221; On the other hand,
      the Xenophontic Sokrates affirmed &#8212; &#8220;The Good and The Beautiful
      have no objective unity at all; they include a variety of items
      altogether dissimilar to each other, yet each having reference to
      some human want or desire: sometimes relieving or preventing pain,
      sometimes conferring pleasure. That which neither contributes to
      relieve any pain or want, nor to confer pleasure, is not Good at
      all.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_92" href="#Footnotev3_32_92"><span
          class="sp">92</span></a> In the Phil&ecirc;bus, Plato borrows
      in part from both of these points of view, though inclining much
      more to the first than to the last. He produces a new eclectic
      doctrine, comprising something from both, and intended to
      harmonise both; announced as applying at once to Man, to Animals,
      to Plants, and to the Universe.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_93"

        Schleiermacher observes about the Phil&ecirc;bus:&#8212; &#8220;Dieses also

        blending Ontology with Ethics.</span></p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the result has not corresponded to his intentions.
      If we turn to the close of the dialogue, we find that the
      principal elements which he assigns as explanatory of Good, and
      the relation in which they stand to each other, stand as much in
      need of explanation as Good itself. If we follow the course of the
      dialogue, we are frequently embarrassed by the language, because
      he is seeking for phrases applicable at once to the Kosmos and to
      Man: or because he passes from one to the other, under the
      assumption of real analogy between them. The extreme generalities
      of Logic or Ontology, upon which Sokrates here dwells &#8212; the
      Determinant and Indeterminate, the Cause, &amp;c. &#8212; do not conduct
      us to the attainment of Good as he himself defines it &#8212; That which
      is desired by, and will give full satisfaction to, all men,
      animals, and plants. The fault appears to me to lie in the very
      scheme of the dialogue. Attempts to discuss Ontology and <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page367" id="v3page367"></a>367</span>Ethics
      in one and the same piece of reasoning, instead of elucidating
      both, only serve to darken both. Aristotle has already made a
      similar remark: and it is after reading the Phil&ecirc;bus that we
      feel most distinctly the value of his comments on Plato in the
      first book of the Nikomachean Ethics. Aristotle has discussed
      Ontology in the Metaphysica and in other treatises: but he
      proclaims explicitly the necessity of discussing Ethics upon their
      own principles: looking at what is good for man, and what is
      attainable by man.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_94"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a> We find
      in the Phil&ecirc;bus many just reflections upon pleasure and its
      varieties: but these might have been better and more clearly
      established, without any appeal to the cosmical dogmas. The
      parallelism between Man and the Kosmos is overstrained and
      inconclusive, like the parallelism in the Republic between the
      collective commonwealth and the individual citizen.</p>

        See especially Ethic. Nikom. i. 4, 1096-1097. Aristotle reasons
        there directly against the Platonic &#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;, but his
        arguments have full application to the exposition in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus. He distinguishes pointedly the ethical from the
        physical point of view. In his discussion of friendship, after
        touching upon various comparisons of the physiological poets,
        and of Plato himself repeating them, he says:&#8212; &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8048;

        which has reason, but no emotion, is unnecessary and confusing.</span></p>
    <p>
      Moreover, when Plato, to prove the conclusion that Intelligence
      and Reason are the governing attributes of man&#8217;s mind, enunciates
      as his premiss that Intelligence and Reason are the governing
      attributes in the Kosmos<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_95"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a> &#8212; the
      premiss introduced is more debateable than the conclusion; and
      would (as he himself intimates) be contested by those against
      whose opposition he was arguing. In fact, the same proposition
      (That Reason and Intelligence are the dominant and controlling
      attributes of man, Passion and Appetite the subordinate) is
      assumed without any proof by Sokrates, both in the Protagoras and
      in the Republic. The Kosmos (in Plato&#8217;s view) has reason and
      intelligence, but experiences no emotion either painful or
      pleasurable: the rational nature of man is thus common to him with
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page368" id="v3page368"></a>368</span>Kosmos,
      his emotional nature is not so. That the mind of each individual
      man was an emanation from the all-pervading mind of the Kosmos or
      universe, and his body a fragmentary portion of the four elements
      composing the cosmical body &#8212; these are propositions which had
      been laid down by Sokrates, as well as by Philolaus and other
      Pythagoreans (perhaps by Pythagoras himself) before the time of
      Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_96" href="#Footnotev3_32_96"><span

      But here in the Phil&ecirc;bus, that analysis appears expanded
      into a larger scheme going beyond Philolaus or the Pythagoreans: <i>viz.</i>
      the recognition of a graduated scale of limits, or a definite
      number of species and sub-species &#8212; intermediate between the One
      or Highest Genus, and the Infinite Many or Individuals &#8212; and
      descending by successive stages of limitation from the Highest to
      the Lowest. What is thus described, is the general framework
      of systematic logical classification, deliberately
      contrived, and founded upon known attributes, common as well as
      differential. It is prescribed as essential to all real cognition;
      if we conceive only the highest Genus or generic name as
      comprehending an infinity of diverse particulars, we have no real
      cognition, until we can assign the intermediate stages of
      specification by which we descend from one to the other.<a

        Ueberweg (&AElig;chtheit und Zeitf. Platon. Schriften, pp.
        204-207) considers the Phil&ecirc;bus, as well as the
        Sophist&ecirc;s and Tim&aelig;us, to be compositions of Plato&#8217;s
        very late age &#8212; partly on the ground of their didactic and
        expository style, the dialogue serving only as form to the
        exponent Sokrates &#8212; partly because he thinks that the nearest
        approach is made in them to that manner of conceiving the
        doctrine of Ideas which Aristotle ascribes to Plato in his old
        age &#8212; that is, the two &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945; or factors of the Ideas. 1. &#932;&#8056; &#7955;&#957;.
        2. &#932;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#957;. This last argument seems to me
        far-fetched. I see no real and sensible approach in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus to this Platonic doctrine of the &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945; of the
        Ideas: at least, the approach is so vague, that one can hardly
        make it a basis of reasoning. But the didactic tone is
        undoubtedly a characteristic of the Phil&ecirc;bus, and seems to
        indicate that the dialogue was composed after Plato had been so
        long established in his school, as to have acquired a pedagogic
        ostentation.</p>

    <p>
      Though there are several other passages of the Platonic dialogues
      in which the method of logical division is inculcated, there is
      none (I think) in which it is prescribed so formally, or
      enunciated with such comprehensive generality, as this before us
      in the Phil&ecirc;bus. Yet the method, after being emphatically
      announced, is but feebly and partially applied, in the distinction
      of different species, both of pleasure and of cognition.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_100" href="#Footnotev3_32_100"><span
          class="sp">100</span></a> The announcement would come more
      suitably, as a preface to the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus:
      wherein the process is applied to given subjects in great detail,
      and at a length which some critics consider excessive: and wherein
      moreover the particular enquiry is expressly proclaimed as
      intended to teach as well as to exemplify the general method.<a

        The purpose of discriminating the different sorts of pleasure is
        intimated, yet seemingly not considered as indispensable, by
        Sokrates; and it is executed certainly in a very unsystematic
        and perfunctory manner, compared with what we read in the
        Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus. (Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 19 B, 20 C,
        32 B-C.)</p>
      <p>
        Mr. Poste, in his note on p. 55 A, expresses surprise at this
        point; and notices it as one among other grounds for suspecting
        that the Phil&ecirc;bus is a composition of two distinct
        fragments, rather carelessly soldered together:&#8212; &#8220;Again after
        Division and Generalization have been propounded as the only
        satisfactory method, it is somewhat strange that both the
        original problems are solved by ordinary Dialectic without any
        recourse to classification. All this becomes intelligible if we
        assume the Phil&ecirc;bus to have arisen from a boldly executed
        junction of two originally separate dialogues.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Acknowledging the want of coherence in the dialogue, I have
        difficulty in conceiving what the two fragments could have been,
        out of which it was compounded. Schleiermacher (Einleit. pp.
        136-137) also points out the negligent execution and heavy march
        of the dialogue.</p>

        agree in condemning the extreme minuteness, the tiresome
        monotony, the useless and petty comparisons, which Plato brings
        together in the multiplied bifurcate divisions of the
        Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus. Socher adduces this as one among
        his reasons for rejecting the dialogue as spurious.</p>

        Phil&ecirc;bus and in Republic. Comparison.</span></p>
    <p>
      The same question as that which is here discussed in the
      Phil&ecirc;bus, is also started in the sixth book of the Republic.
      It is worth while to compare the different handling, here and
      there. &#8220;Whatever else we possess (says Sokrates in the Republic),
      and whatever else we may know is of no value, unless we also
      possess and know Good. In the opinion of most persons, Pleasure is
      The Good: in the opinion of accomplished and philosophical men,
      intelligence (&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;) is the Good. But when we ask Intelligence,
      <i>of what</i>? these philosophers cannot inform us: they end by
      telling us, ridiculously enough, Intelligence of <i>The Good</i>.
      Thus, while blaming us for not knowing what The Good is, they make
      an answer which implies that we do already know it: in saying,
      Intelligence of the Good, they of course presume that we know what
      they mean by the word. Then again, those who pronounce Pleasure to
      be the Good, are not less involved in error; since they are forced
      to admit that some Pleasures are Evil; thus making Good and Evil
      to be the same. It is plain therefore that there are many and
      grave disputes what The Good is.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_102"

        confidently, as if it were known, while it is subject of
        constant dispute. Plato himself wavers about it; gives different
        explanations, and sometimes professes ignorance, sometimes talks
        about it confidently.</span></p>
    <p>
      In this passage of the Republic Plato points out that Intelligence
      cannot be understood, except as determined by or referring to some
      Object or End: and that those who tendered Intelligence <i>per se</i>
      for an explanation of The Good (as Sokrates does in the
      Phil&ecirc;bus), assumed as known the very point in dispute which
      they professed to explain. This is an important remark in regard
      to ethical discussions: and it were to be wished that Plato had
      himself avoided the mistake which he here blames in others. The
      Platonic Sokrates frequently tells us that he does not know what
      Good is. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page371" id="v3page371"></a>371</span>In
      the sixth Book of the Republic, having come to a point where his
      argument required him to furnish a positive explanation of it, he
      expressly declines the obligation and makes his escape amidst the
      clouds of metaphor.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_103"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a> In the
      Protagoras, he pronounces Good to be identical with pleasure and
      avoidance of pain, in the largest sense and under the supervision
      of calculating Intelligence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_104"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a> In the
      second Book of the Republic, we find what is substantially the
      same explanation as that of the Protagoras, given (though in a
      more enlarged and analytical manner) by Glaukon and assented to by
      Sokrates; to the effect that Good is tripartite,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_105" href="#Footnotev3_32_105"><span
          class="sp">105</span></a> <i>viz.</i>: 1. That which we
      desire for itself, without any reference to consequences &#8212; <i>e.
        g.</i>, enjoyment and the innocuous pleasures. 2. That which we
      desire on a double account, both for itself and by reason of its
      consequences &#8212; <i>e. g.</i>, good health, eyesight, intelligence,
      &amp;c. 3. That which we do not desire, perhaps even shun, for
      itself: but which we desire, or at least accept, by reason of its
      consequences &#8212; such as gymnastics, medical treatment, discipline,
      &amp;c. Again, in the Gorgias and elsewhere, Plato seems to
      confine the definition of Good to the two last of these three
      heads, rejecting the first: for he distinguishes pointedly the
      Good from the Pleasurable. Yet while thus wavering in his
      conception of the term, Plato often admits it into the discussions
      as if it were not merely familiar, but clear and well-understood
      by every one.</p>

    <p>
      In the present dialogue, Plato lays down certain characteristic
      marks whereby The Supreme Good may be known. These marks are
      subjective &#8212; relative to the feelings and appreciation of sentient
      beings &#8212; to all mankind, and even to animals and plants. Good is
      explicitly defined by the property of conferring happiness. The
      Good is declared to be &#8220;that habit and disposition of mind which
      has power to confer on all men a happy life&#8221;:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_106" href="#Footnotev3_32_106"><span
          class="sp">106</span></a> it is perfect and all sufficient:
      every creature that knows Good, desires and hunts after it,
      demanding <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page372"
          id="v3page372"></a>372</span>nothing farther when it is
      attained, and caring for nothing else except what is attained
      along with it:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_107"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_107"><span class="sp">107</span></a> it is
      the object of choice for all plants and animals, and if any one
      prefers any thing else, he only does so through ignorance or from
      some untoward necessity:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_108"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> it is
      most delightful and agreeable to all.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_109"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a> This
      is what Plato tells us as to the characteristic attributes of
      Good. And the test which Sokrates applies, to determine whether
      Pleasure does or does not correspond with these attributes, is an
      appeal to individual choice or judgment. &#8220;Would you choose? Would
      <i>any one</i> be satisfied?&#8221; Though this appeal ought by the
      conditions of the problem to be made to mankind generally, and is
      actually made to Protarchus as one specimen of them &#8212; yet Sokrates
      says at the end of the dialogue that all except philosophers
      choose wrong, being too ignorant or misguided to choose aright.
      Now it is certain that what these philosophers choose, will not
      satisfy the aspirations of all other persons besides. It may be
      Good, in reference to the philosophers themselves: but it will
      fail to answer those larger conditions which Plato has just laid
      down.</p>

        Sydenham, Translation of Phil&ecirc;bus, note, p. 48, observes &#8212;
        &#8220;Whether Happiness be to be found in Speculative Wisdom or in
        Pleasure, or in some other possession or enjoyment, it can be
        seated nowhere but in the soul. For Happiness has no existence
        anywhere but where it is felt and known. Now, it is no less
        certain, that only the soul is sensible of pain and pleasure,
        than it is, that only the soul is capable of knowledge, and of
        thinking either foolishly or wisely.&#8221;</p>

        putting the question &#8212; The alternative which he tenders has no
        fair application.</span></p>
    <p>
      In submitting the question to individual choice, Plato does not
      keep clear either of confusion or of contradiction. If this Summum
      Bonum be understood as the End comprising the full satisfaction of
      human wishes and imaginations, without limitation by certain given
      actualities &#8212; and if the option be tendered to a man already
      furnished with his share of the various desires generated in
      actual life &#8212; such a man will naturally demand entire absence of
      all pains, with pleasures such as to satisfy all his various
      desires: not merely the most intense pleasures (which Plato
      intends to prove, not to be pleasures at all), but other pleasures
      also. He will wish (if you thus <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page373" id="v3page373"></a>373</span>suppose him
      master of Fortunatus&#8217;s wishing-cap) to include in his enjoyments
      pleasures which do not usually go together, and which may even, in
      the real conditions of life, exclude one another: no boundary
      being prescribed to his wishing power. He will wish for the
      pleasures of knowledge or intelligence, of self-esteem, esteem
      from others, sympathy, &amp;c., as well as for those of sense. He
      will put in his claim for pleasures, without any of those
      antecedent means and conditions which, in real life, are necessary
      to procure them. Such being the state of the question, the
      alternative tendered by Plato &#8212; Pleasure, versus Intelligence or
      Knowledge &#8212; has no fair application. Plato himself expressly
      states that pleasure, though generically One, is specifically
      multiform, and has many varieties different from, even opposite
      to, each other: among which varieties one is, the pleasure of
      knowledge or intelligence itself.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_110"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a> The
      person to whom the question is submitted, has a right to claim
      these pleasures of knowledge among the rest, as portions of his
      Summum Bonum. And when Plato proceeds to ask &#8212; Will you be
      satisfied to possess pleasure only, without the least spark of
      intelligence, without memory, without eyesight? &#8212; he departs from
      the import of his previous question, and withdraws from the sum
      total of pleasure many of its most important items: since we must
      of course understand that the pleasures of intelligence will
      disappear along with intelligence itself,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_111" href="#Footnotev3_32_111"><span
          class="sp">111</span></a> and that the pains of conscious want
      of intelligence will be felt instead of them.</p>

        fairly compared &#8212; Pleasure is an End, Intelligence a Means.
        Nothing can be compared with Pleasure, except some other End.</span></p>
    <p>
      That the antithesis here enunciated by Plato is not legitimate or
      logical, we may see on other grounds also. Pleasure and
      Intelligence cannot be placed in competition with each other for
      recognition as Summum Bonum: which, as described by Plato himself,
      is of the nature of an End, while Intelligence is of the nature of
      a means or agency &#8212; indispensable indeed, yet of no value unless
      it be exercised, and rightly exercised towards its appropriate
      end, which end must be separately declared.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_112" href="#Footnotev3_32_112"><span
          class="sp">112</span></a> Intelligence is a durable
      acquisition stored up, like the good health, moral character, or
      established habits, of each individual person: it is a <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page374" id="v3page374"></a>374</span>capital
      engaged in the production of interest, and its value is measured
      by the interest produced. You cannot with propriety put the means
      &#8212; the Capital &#8212; in one scale, and the End &#8212; the Interest &#8212; in the
      other, so as to ascertain which of the two weighs most. A prudent
      man will refrain from any present enjoyment which trenches on his
      capital: but this is because the maintenance of the capital is
      essential to all future acquisitions and even future maintenance.
      So too, Intelligence is essential as a means or condition to the
      attainment of pleasure in its largest sense &#8212; that is, including
      avoidance or alleviation of pain or suffering: if therefore you
      choose to understand pleasure in a narrower sense, not including
      therein avoidance of pain (as Plato understands it in this portion
      of the Phil&ecirc;bus), the comprehensive end to which
      Intelligence corresponds may be compared with Pleasure and
      declared more valuable &#8212; but Intelligence itself cannot with
      propriety be so compared. Such a comparison can only be properly
      instituted when you consider the exercise of Intelligence as
      involving (which it undoubtedly does<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_113"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a>)
      pleasures of its own; which pleasures form part of the End, and
      may fairly be measured against other pleasures and pains. But
      nothing can be properly compared with Pleasure, except some other
      supposed End: and those theorists who reject Pleasure must specify
      some other <i>Terminus ad quem</i> &#8212; otherwise intelligence has
      no clear meaning.</p>

      <p>
        Aristotle, in the Nikomach. Ethic. (i. 4, 1096, b. 10), makes a
        distinction between &#8212; 1. &#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8048; &#948;&#953;&#969;&#954;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#8212;

        Plato himself makes the same distinction at the beginning of the
        second book of the Republic. But though it is convenient to draw
        attention to this distinction, for the clear understanding of
        the subject, you cannot ask with propriety which of the two lots
        is most valuable. The value of the two is equal: the one cannot
        be had without the other.</p>

        attainment of pleasure and diminution of pain, postulated
        Intelligence as the governing agency.</span></p>
    <p>
      Now the Hedonists in Plato&#8217;s age, when they declared Pleasure to
      be the supreme Good, understood Pleasure in its widest sense, as
      including not merely all varieties of pleasure, mental and bodily
      alike, but also avoidance of pain (in fact Epikurus dwelt
      especially upon this last point). Moreover, they did not intend to
      depreciate Intelligence, but on the contrary postulated it <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page375" id="v3page375"></a>375</span>as
      a governing agency, indispensable to right choice and comparative
      estimation between different pleasures and pains. That Eudoxus,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_114" href="#Footnotev3_32_114"><span
          class="sp">114</span></a> the geometer and astronomer, did
      this, we may be sure: but besides, this is the way in which the
      Hedonistic doctrine is expounded by Plato himself. In his
      Protagoras, Sokrates advocates that doctrine, against the Sophist
      who is unwilling to admit it. In the exposition there given by
      Sokrates, Pleasure is announced as The Good to be sought, Pain as
      The Evil to be avoided or reduced to a minimum. But precisely
      because the End, to be pursued through constant diversity of
      complicated situations, is thus defined &#8212; for that very reason he
      declares that the dominant or sovereign element in man must be,
      the measuring and calculating Intelligence; since such is the sole
      condition under which the End can be attained or approached. In
      the theory of the Hedonists, there was no antithesis, but
      indispensable conjunction and implication, between Pleasure and
      Intelligence.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_115" href="#Footnotev3_32_115"><span
          class="sp">115</span></a> And if it be said, that by declaring
      Pleasure (and avoidance of Pain) to be the End, Intelligence the
      means, &#8212; they lowered the dignity of the latter as compared with
      the former:&#8212; we may reply that the dignity of Intelligence is
      exalted to the maximum when it is enthroned as the ruling and
      controuling agent over the human mind.</p>

        Eudoxus is cited by Aristotle (Ethic. Nikom. x. 2) as the great
        champion of the Hedonistic theory. He is characterised by
        Aristotle as &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#963;&#974;&#966;&#961;&#969;&#957;.</p>

        compared, and are compared by Plato, with other pleasures, and
        declared to be of more value. This is arguing upon the
        Hedonistic basis.</span></p>
    <p>
      In a scheme of mental philosophy, Emotion and Intellect are
      properly treated as distinct phenomena requiring to be explained
      separately, though perpetually co-existent and interfering with
      each other. But in an ethical discourse about Summum Bonum, the
      antithesis between Pleasure and Intelligence, on which the
      Phil&ecirc;bus turns, is from the outset illogical. What gives to
      it an apparent plausibility, is, That the exercise of Intelligence
      has pleasures and pains of its <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page376" id="v3page376"></a>376</span>own, and
      includes therefore in itself a part of the End, besides being the
      constant and indispensable directing force or Means. Now, though
      pleasure <i>in genere</i> cannot be weighed in the scale against
      Intelligence, yet the pleasures and pains of Intelligence may be
      fairly and instructively compared with other pleasures and pains.
      You may contend that the pleasures of Intelligence are superior in
      quality, as well as less alloyed by accompanying pains. This
      comparison is really instituted by Plato in other dialogues;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_116" href="#Footnotev3_32_116"><span
          class="sp">116</span></a> and we find the two questions
      apparently running together in his mind as if they were one and
      the same. Yet the fact is, that those who affirm the pleasures
      attending the exercise of Intelligence to be better and greater,
      and the pains less, than those which attend other occupations, are
      really arguing upon the Hedonistic basis.<a

      <p>
        Again in the Ph&aelig;don, he tells us that we are not to weigh
        pleasures against pleasures, or pains against pains, but all of
        them against &#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; or Intelligence (p. 69 A-B). This appears
        distinctly to contradict what Sokrates affirms in the
        Protagoras. But when we turn to another passage of the
        Ph&aelig;don (p. 114 E), we find Sokrates recognising a class of
        pleasures attached to the exercise of Intelligence, and
        declaring them to be more valuable than the pleasures of sense,
        or any others. This is a very different proposition: but in both
        passages Plato had probably the same comparison in his mind.</p>
      <p>
        Sydenham, in a note to his translation of the Phil&ecirc;bus
        (pp. 42-43), observes &#8212; &#8220;if Protarchus, when he took on himself
        to be an advocate for pleasure, had included, in his meaning of
        the word, all such pleasures as are purely mental, his opinion,
        fairly and rightly understood, could not have been different in
        the main, from what Sokrates here professes &#8212; That in every
        particular case, to discern what is best in action, and to
        perceive what is true in speculation, is the chief good of man;
        unless, indeed, it should afterwards come into question which of
        the two kinds of pleasure, the sensual or the mental, was to be
        preferred. For if it should appear that in this point they were
        both of the same mind, the controversy between them would be
        found a mere logomachy, or contention about words (as between
        Epicureans and Stoics), of the same kind as that would be
        between two persons, one of whom asserted that to a musical ear
        the proper and true good was Harmony, while the other contended
        that the good lay not in the Harmony itself, but in the pleasure
        which the musical ear felt from hearing it: or like a
        controversy among three persons, one of whom having asserted
        that to all animals living under the northern frigid zone, the
        Sun in Cancer was the greatest blessing; and another having
        asserted that not the Sun was that chief blessing to those
        northern animals, but the warmth which he afforded them; the
        third should imagine that he corrected or amended the two former
        by saying &#8212; That those animals were thus highly blest neither by
        the Sun, nor by the warmth which his rays afforded them, but by
        the joy or pleasure which they felt from the return of the Sun
        and warmth.&#8221;</p>

        Plato, in Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 63 C-D, denounces and discards the
        vehement pleasures because they disturb the right exercise of
        Reason and Intelligence. Aristotle, after alluding to this
        doctrine, presents the same fact under a different point of
        view, as one case of a general law. Each variety of pleasure
        belongs to, and is consequent on, a certain &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; of the
        system. Each variety of pleasure promotes and consummates its
        own &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;, but impedes or arrests other different &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;.
        Thus the pleasures of hunting, of gymnastic contest, of hearing
        or playing music &#8212; cause each of these &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;, upon which
        each pleasure respectively depends, to be more completely
        developed; but are unfavourable to different &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;, such as
        learning by heart, or solving a geometrical problem. The
        pleasure belonging to these latter, again, is unfavourable to
        the performance of the former &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#953;. Study often hurts
        health or good management of property; but if a man has pleasure
        in study, he will perform that work with better fruit and
        result.</p>
      <p>
        This is a juster view of &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8052; than what we read in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus. The illogical antithesis of Pleasure <i>in
          genere</i>, against Intelligence, finds no countenance from
        Aristotle.</p>
      <p>
        See Ethic. Nikom. vii. 13, 1153, a. 20; x. 5, p. 1175; also

    <p>
      Another remark may be made on the way in which Plato argues the
      question in the Phil&ecirc;bus against the Hedonists. He draws a
      marked line of separation between Pleasure &#8212; and avoidance,
      relief, or mitigation, of Pain. He does not merely distinguish the
      two, but sets them in opposing antithesis. Wherever there is pain
      to be relieved, he will not allow the title of <i>pleasurable</i>
      to be bestowed on the situation. That is not <i>true</i>
      pleasure: in other words, it is no pleasure at all. He does not go
      quite so far as some contemporary theorists, the Fastidious
      Pleasure-Haters, who repudiated all pleasures without exception.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_118" href="#Footnotev3_32_118"><span
          class="sp">118</span></a> He allows a few rare exceptions; the
      sensual pleasures of sight, hearing, and smell &#8212; and the pleasures
      of exercising Intelligence, which (these latter most erroneously)
      he affirms to be not disentitled by any accompanying pains. His
      catalogue of pleasures is thus reduced to a chosen few, and these
      too enjoyable only by a chosen few among mankind.</p>

      Now this very restricted sense of the word Pleasure is peculiar to
      Plato, and peculiar even to some of the Platonic dialogues. Those
      who affirmed Pleasure to be the Good, did not understand the word
      in the same restricted sense. When Sokrates in the Protagoras
      affirms, and when Sokrates in the Phil&ecirc;bus denies, that
      Pleasure is identical with Good, &#8212; the affirmation and the denial
      do not bear upon the same substantial meaning.<a

        Among the arguments employed by Sokrates in the Phil&ecirc;bus
        to disprove the identity between &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8052; and &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;, one is, that
        &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8052; is a &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, and is therefore essentially a process of
        imperfection or transition into some ulterior &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, for the
        sake of which alone it existed (Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 53-55);
        whereas Good is essentially an &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#8212; perfect, complete,
        all-sufficient &#8212; and must not be confounded with the process
        whereby it is brought about. He illustrates this by telling us
        that the species of &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; called ship-building exists only for
        the sake of the ship &#8212; the &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; in which it terminates; but
        that the fabricating process, and the result in which it ends,
        are not to be confounded together.</p>
      <p>
        The doctrine that pleasure is a &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, Plato cites as laid
        down by others: certain &#954;&#959;&#956;&#968;&#959;&#943;, whom he does not name, but whom
        the critics suppose to be Aristippus and the Kyrenaici.
        Aristotle (in the seventh and tenth books of Ethic. Nik.) also
        criticises and impugns the doctrine that pleasure is a &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;:
        but he too omits to name the persons by whom it was propounded.</p>
      <p>
        Possibly Aristippus may have been the author of it: but we can
        hardly tell what he meant, or how he defended it. Plato derides
        him for his inconsistency in calling pleasure a &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, while
        he at the same time maintained it to be the Good: but the
        derision is founded upon an assumption which Aristippus would
        have denied. Aristippus would not have admitted that all &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;
        existed only for the sake of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;: and he would have replied to
        Plato&#8217;s argument, illustrated by the example of ship-building,
        by saying that the &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; called a <i>ship</i> existed only for
        the sake of the services which it was destined to render in
        transporting persons and goods: that if &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; existed for the
        sake of &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;, it was no less true that &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945; existed for the
        sake of &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;. Plato therefore had no good foundation for the
        sarcasm which he throws out against Aristippus.</p>
      <p>
        The reasoning of Aristotle (E. N. x. 3-4; compare Eth. Magn. ii.
        1204-1205) against the doctrine, that pleasure is &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; or
        &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, is drawn from a different point of view, and is quite
        as unfavourable to the opinions of Plato as to those of
        Aristippus. His language however in the Rhetoric is somewhat
        different (i. p. 1370, b. 33).</p>
      <p>
        Aristippus is said to have defined pleasure as &#955;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, and
        pain as &#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; (Diog. L. ii. 86-89). The word &#954;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;
        is so vague, that one can hardly say what it means, without some
        words of context: but I doubt whether he meant anything more
        than &#8220;<i>a marked change of consciousness</i>&#8221;. The word &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;
        is also very obscure: and we are not sure that Aristippus
        employed it.</p>

    <p>
      Again, in the arguments of Sokrates against pleasure <i>in genere</i>,
      we find him also singling out as examples the intense pleasures,
      which he takes much pains to discredit. The remarks which he makes
      here upon the intense pleasures, considered as elements of
      happiness, have much truth taken generally. Though he exaggerates
      the matter when he says that many persons would rejoice to have
      itch and irritation, in order that they might have the pleasure of
      scratching<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_120" href="#Footnotev3_32_120"><span
          class="sp">120</span></a> &#8212; and that persons in a fever have
      greater pleasure as well as greater pain than persons in health &#8212;
      yet he is correct to this extent, that the disposition to hanker
      after intense pleasures, to forget their painful sequel in many
      cases, and to pay for them a greater price than they are worth, is
      widely disseminated among mankind. But this is no valid objection
      against the Hedonistic theory, as it was enunciated and defended
      by its principal advocates &#8212; by the <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page379" id="v3page379"></a>379</span>Platonic
      Sokrates (in the Protagoras), by Aristippus, Eudoxus,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_121" href="#Footnotev3_32_121"><span
          class="sp">121</span></a> Epikurus. All of them took account
      of this frequent wrong tendency, and arranged their warnings
      accordingly. All of them discouraged, not less than Plato, such
      intense enjoyments as produced greater mischief in the way of
      future pain and disappointment, or as obstructed the exercise of
      calm reason.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_122" href="#Footnotev3_32_122"><span
          class="sp">122</span></a> All of them, when they talked of
      pleasure as the Supreme Good, understood thereby a rational
      estimate and comparison of pleasures and pains, present and
      future, so as to ensure the maximum of the former and the minimum
      of the latter. All of them postulated a calculating and governing
      Reason. Epikurus undoubtedly, and I believe the other two also,
      recommended a life of moderation, tranquillity, and meditative
      reason: they deprecated the violent emotions, whether sensual,
      ambitious, or money-getting.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_123"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a> The
      objections therefore here stated by Sokrates, in so far as they
      are derived from the mischievous consequences of indulgence in the
      intense pleasures, do not avail against the Hedonistic theory, as
      explained either by Plato himself (Protagoras) or by any theorists
      of the Platonic century. </p>

        strong interest which he felt in scientific pursuits is marked

        The equivocal sense of the word Pleasure is the same as that
        which Plato notes in the Symposion to attach to Eros or Love (p.
        205). When employed in philosophical discussion, it sometimes <i>is</i>
        used (and always <i>ought</i> to be used) in its full extent of
        generic comprehension: sometimes in a narrower sense, so as to
        include only a few of the more intense pleasures, chiefly the
        physical, and especially the sexual; sometimes in a sense still
        more peculiar, partly as opposed to <i>duty</i>, partly as
        opposed to <i>business</i>, <i>work</i>, <i>utility</i>,
        &amp;c. Opponents of the Hedonists took advantage of the
        unfavourable associations attached to the word in these narrower
        and special senses, to make objections tell against the theory
        which employed the word in its widest generic sense.</p>

        See the beautiful lines of Lucretius, Book ii. init. When we
        read the three acrimonious treatises in which Plutarch attacks
        the Epikureans (Non Posse Suaviter Vivi, adv. Koloten, De
        Latenter Vivendo), we find him complaining, not that Epikurus
        thought too much about pleasures, or that he thought too much
        about the intense pleasures, but quite the reverse. Epikurus (he
        says) made out too poor a catalogue of pleasures: he was too
        easily satisfied with a small amount and variety of pleasures:
        he dwelt too much upon the absence of pain, as being, when
        combined with a very little pleasure, as much as man ought to
        look for: he renounced all the most vehement and delicious
        pleasures, those of political activity and contemplative study,
        which constitute the great charms of life (1097 F-1098 E-1092
        E-1093-1094). Plutarch attacks Epikurus upon grounds really
        Hedonistic.</p>

    <p>
      We find Plato in his various dialogues working out different
      points of view, partly harmonious, partly conflicting, upon
      ethical theory. Thus in the Gorgias, Sokrates <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page380" id="v3page380"></a>380</span>insists
      eloquently upon the antithesis between the Immediate and Transient
      on the one hand, which he calls Pleasure or Pain &#8212; and the Distant
      and Permanent on the other, which he calls Good or Profit, Hurt or
      Evil. In the Protagoras, Sokrates acknowledges the same
      antithesis: but he points out that the Good or Profit, Hurt or
      Evil, resolve themselves into elements generically the same as
      those of the Immediate and Transient &#8212; Pleasure and Pain: so that
      all which we require is, a calculating Intelligence to assess and
      balance correctly the pleasures and pains in every given case. In
      the Phil&ecirc;bus, Sokrates takes a third line, distinct from
      both the other two dialogues: he insists upon a new antithesis,
      between True Pleasures &#8212; and False Pleasures. If a Pleasure be
      associated with any proportion, however small, of Pain or
      Uneasiness &#8212; or with any false belief or impression &#8212; he denounces
      it as false and impostrous, and strikes it out of the list of
      pleasures. The small residue which is left after such deduction,
      consists of pleasures recommended altogether by what Plato calls
      their truth, and addressing themselves to the love of truth in a
      few chosen minds. The attainment of Good &#8212; the object of the
      practical aspirations &#8212; is presented as a secondary appendage of
      the attainment of Truth &#8212; the object of the speculative or
      intellectual energies.</p>

      remarkable passage. &#8220;I have often heard Gorgias affirm&#8221; (says
      Protarchus) &#8220;that among all arts, the art of persuasion stands
      greatly pre-eminent: since, it ensures subservience from all, not
      by force, but with their own free consent.&#8221; To which Sokrates
      replies &#8212; &#8220;I was not then enquiring what art or science stands
      pre-eminent as the greatest, or as the best, or as conferring most
      benefit upon us &#8212; but what art or science investigates clear,
      exact, and full truth, though it be in itself small, and may
      afford small benefit. You <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page381" id="v3page381"></a>381</span>need not quarrel
      with Gorgias, for you may admit to him the superiority of his art
      in respect of usefulness to mankind, while my art (dialectic
      philosophy) is superior in respect of accuracy. I observed just
      now, that a small piece of white colour which is pure, surpasses
      in truth a large area which is not pure. We must not look to the
      comparative profitable consequences or good repute of the various
      sciences or arts, but to any natural aspiration which may exist in
      our minds to love truth, and to do every thing for the sake of
      truth. It will then appear that no other science or art strives
      after truth so earnestly as Dialectic.&#8221;<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_125"

        Sokrates in the Gorgias insists upon the constant intermixture
        of pleasure with pain, as an argument to prove that pleasure
        cannot be identical with good: pleasure and pain (he says) go
        together but good and evil cannot go together: therefore
        pleasure cannot be good, pain cannot be evil (Gorgias, pp.
        496-497). But he distinguishes pleasures into the good and the
        bad; not into the true and the false, as they are distinguished
        in the Phil&ecirc;bus and the Republic (ix. pp. 583-585).</p>

      <p>
        Here, as elsewhere, I translate the substance of the passage,
        adopting the amendments of Dr. Badham and Mr. Poste (see Mr.
        Poste&#8217;s note), which appear to me valuable improvements of a
        confused text.</p>
      <p>
        It seems probable enough that what is here said, conceding so
        large a measure of credit to Gorgias and his art, may be
        intended expressly as a mitigation of the bitter polemic
        assigned to Sokrates in the Gorgias. This is, however,
        altogether conjecture.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If we turn to the Gorgias, we find the very same claim advanced by
      Gorgias on behalf of his own art, as that which Protarchus here
      advances: but while Sokrates here admits it, in the Gorgias he
      repudiates it with emphasis, and even with contumely: ranking
      rhetoric among those employments which minister only to present
      pleasure, but which are neither intended to yield, nor ever do
      yield, any profitable result. Here in the Phil&ecirc;bus, the
      antithesis between immediate pleasure and distant profit is
      scarcely noticed. Sokrates resigns to Gorgias and to others of the
      like stamp, a superiority not merely in the art of flattering and
      tricking the immediate sensibilities of mankind, but in that of
      contributing to their permanent profit and advantage. It is in a
      spirit contrary to the Gorgias, and contrary also to the Republic
      (in which latter we read the memorable declaration &#8212; That the
      miseries of society will have no respite until government is in
      the hands of philosophers<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_126"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a>), that
      Sokrates here abnegates on behalf of philosophy all efficacious
      pretension of conferring profit or happiness on mankind generally,
      and claims for it only the pure delight of satisfying <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page382" id="v3page382"></a>382</span>the
      truth-seeking aspirations. Now these aspirations have little force
      except in a few chosen minds; in the bulk of mankind the love of
      truth is feeble, and the active search for truth almost unknown.
      We thus see that in the Phil&ecirc;bus it is the speculative few
      who are present to the imagination of Plato, more than the
      ordinary working, suffering, enjoying Many.</p>

        Plato applies the same principle of classification &#8212; true and
        false &#8212; to Cognitions and Pleasures.</span></p>
    <p>
      Aristotle, in the commencement of his Metaphysica, recommends
      Metaphysics or First Philosophy to the reader, by affirming that,
      though other studies are more useful or more necessary to man,
      none is equal to it in respect of truth and exactness,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_127" href="#Footnotev3_32_127"><span
          class="sp">127</span></a> because it teaches us to understand
      First Causes and Principles. The like pretension is put forward by
      Plato in the Phil&ecirc;bus<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_128"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> on
      behalf of dialectic; which he designates as the science of all
      real, permanent, unchangeable, Entia. Taking Dialectic as the
      maximum or Verissimum, Plato classifies other sciences or
      cognitions according as they approach closer to it in truth or
      exactness &#8212; according as they contain more of precise measurement
      and less of conjecture. Sciences or cognitions are thus classified
      according as they are more or less true and pure. But because this
      principle of classification is fairly applicable to cognitions,
      Plato conceives that it may be made applicable to Pleasures also.
      One characteristic feature of the Phil&ecirc;bus is the attempt to
      apply the predicates, <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, to pleasures
      and pains, as they are applicable to cognitions or opinions: an
      attempt against which Protarchus is made to protest, and which
      Sokrates altogether fails in justifying,<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_129" href="#Footnotev3_32_129"><span
          class="sp">129</span></a> though he employs a train of

      <p>
        The various arguments, intended to prove this conclusion, are
        continued from p. 36 to p. 51. The same doctrine is advocated by
        Sokrates in the Republic, ix. pp. 583-584.</p>
      <p>
        The doctrine is briefly stated by the Platonist Nemesius, De
        Natur. Hominis, p. 223. &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#928;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7985; &#956;&#941;&#957;

      <p>
        A brief but clear abstract of the argument will be found in Dr.
        Badham&#8217;s Preface to the Phil&ecirc;bus (pp. viii.-xi.). Compare
        also Stallbaum&#8217;s Prolegg. ch. v. p. 50, seq.</p>

        applicable to pleasures.</span></p>
    <p>
      In this train of argument we find a good deal of just and <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page383" id="v3page383"></a>383</span>instructive
      psychological remark: but nothing at all which proves the
      conclusion that there are or can be <i>false pleasures</i> or <i>false
        pains</i>. We have (as Sokrates shows) false remembrances of
      past pleasures and pains &#8212; false expectations, hopes, and fears of
      future: we have pleasures alloyed by accompanying pains, and pains
      qualified by accompanying pleasures: we have pleasures and pains
      dependent upon false beliefs: but false pleasures we neither have
      nor can have. The predicate is altogether inapplicable to the
      subject. It is applicable to the intellectual side of our nature,
      not to the emotional. A pleasure (or a pain) is what it seems,
      neither more nor less; its essence consists in being felt.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_130" href="#Footnotev3_32_130"><span
          class="sp">130</span></a> There are false beliefs, disbeliefs,
      judgments, opinions &#8212; but not false pleasures or pains. The
      pleasure of the dreamer or madman is not false, though it may be
      founded on illusory belief: the joy of a man informed that he has
      just been appointed to a lucrative and honourable post, the grief
      of a father on hearing that his son has been killed in battle, are
      neither of them false, though the news which both persons are made
      to believe may be totally false, and though the feelings will thus
      be of short duration. Plato observes that the state which he calls
      neutrality or indifference appears pleasurable when it follows
      pain, and painful when it results from an interruption of
      pleasure: here is a state which appears alternately to be both,
      though it is in reality neither: the pleasure or pain, therefore,
      whichever it be, he infers to be <i>false</i><a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_131" href="#Footnotev3_32_131"><span
          class="sp">131</span></a> But there is no falsehood in the
      case: the state described <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page384" id="v3page384"></a>384</span>is what it
      appears to be &#8212; pleasurable or painful: Plato describes it
      erroneously when he calls it the same state, or one of neutrality.
      Pleasure and Pain are both of them phenomena of present
      consciousness. They are what they seem: none of them can be
      properly called (as Plato calls them) &#8220;apparent pleasures which
      have no reality&#8221;.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_132"

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 43-44; Republic, ix. p. 583.</p>
      <p>
        I copy the following passage from Professor Bain&#8217;s work on &#8220;The
        Emotions and the Will,&#8221; the fullest and most philosophical
        account of the emotions that I know (pp. 615-616; 3rd ed., pp.
        550 seq.):&#8212; </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;It is a general law of the mental constitution, more or less
        recognised by inquirers into the human mind, that change of
        impression is essential to consciousness in every form.&#8230; There
        are notable examples to show, that one unvarying action upon the
        senses fails to give any perception whatever. Take the motion of
        the earth about its axis and through space, whereby we are
        whirled with immense velocity, but at a uniform pace, being
        utterly insensible of the circumstance.&#8230; It is the change from
        rest to motion that wakens our sensibility, and, conversely,
        from motion to rest. A uniform condition, as respects either
        state, is devoid of any quickening influence on the mind.&#8230; We
        have repeatedly seen pleasures depending for their existence on
        previous pains, and pains on pleasures experienced or conceived.
        Such are the contrasting states of Liberty and Restraint, Power
        and Impotence. Many pleasures owe their effect as such to mere
        cessation. For example, the pleasures of exercise do not need to
        be preceded by pain: it is enough that there has been a certain
        intermission, coupled with the nourishment of the exhausted
        parts. These are of course our best pleasures. By means of this
        class, we might have a life of enjoyment without pain: although,
        in fact, the other is more or less mixed up in every one&#8217;s
        experience. Exercise, Repose, the pleasures of the different
        Senses and Emotions, might be made to alternate, so as to give a
        constant succession of pleasure: each being sufficiently dormant
        during the exercise of the others, to reanimate the
        consciousness when its turn comes. It also happens that some of
        those modes of delight are increased, by being preceded by a
        certain amount of a painful opposite. Thus, confinement adds to
        the pleasure of exercise, and protracted exertion to that of
        repose. Fasting increases the enjoyment of meals; and being much
        chilled prepares us for a higher zest in the accession of
        warmth. It is not necessary, however, in those cases, that the
        privation should amount to positive pain, in order to the
        existence of the pleasure. The enjoyment of food may be
        experienced, although the previous hunger may not be in any way
        painful: at all events, with no more pain than the certainty of
        the coming meal can effectually appease. There is still another
        class of our delights depending entirely upon previous
        suffering, as in the sudden cessation of acute pains, or the
        sudden relief from great depression. Here the rebound from one
        nervous condition to another is a stimulant of positive
        pleasure: constituting a small, but altogether inadequate,
        compensation for the prior misery. The pleasurable sensation of
        good health presupposes the opposite experience in a still
        larger measure. Uninterrupted health, though an instrumentality
        for working out many enjoyments, of itself gives no sensation.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        It appears to me that this passage of Mr. Bain&#8217;s work
        discriminates and sets out what there is of truth in Plato&#8217;s
        doctrine about the pure and painless pleasures. In his first
        volume (The Senses and the Intellect) Mr. Bain has laid down and
        explained the great fundamental fact of the system, that it
        includes spontaneous sources of activity; which, after repose
        and nourishment, require to be exerted, and afford a certain
        pleasure in the course of being exerted. There is no antecedent
        pain to be relieved: but privation (which is only a grade and
        variety of pain, and sometimes considerable pain) is felt if the
        exertion be hindered. This doctrine of spontaneous activity,
        employed by Mr. Bain successfully to explain a large variety of
        mental phenomena, is an important and valuable extension of that
        which Aristotle lays down in the Ethics, that pleasure is an
        accessory or adjunct of &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#7936;&#957;&#949;&#956;&#960;&#972;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; (&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;

        obtain any separate extraneous pleasure or to relieve any
        separate extraneous pain (&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8217; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8048;&#962; &#948;&#8217; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#945;&#7985;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#943;, &#7936;&#966;&#8217; &#8038;&#957;

        p. 42 C, which last sentence is better explained (I think) in
        the note of Dr. Badham than in that of Mr. Poste.</p>
      <p>
        Mr. Poste observes justly, in his note on p. 40 C:&#8212; &#8220;The falsely
        anticipated pleasure in mistaken Hope may be called, as it is
        here called, False Pleasure. This is, however, an inaccurate
        expression. It is not the Pleasure, but the Imagination of it (<i>i.e.</i>
        the Imagination or Opinion) that is false. Sokrates therefore
        does not dwell upon this point, though Protarchus allows the
        expression to pass.&#8221; The last phrase of the passage which I have
        thus transcribed (&#8220;Sokrates <i>therefore</i> does not dwell
        upon this point&#8221;) is less accurate than that which precedes: for
        it seems to imply that the Sokrates of Phil&ecirc;bus <i>admits</i>
        the inaccuracy of the expression, which seems to me not borne
        out by the text of the dialogue. Both here and elsewhere in the
        dialogue, the doctrine, that many pleasures are false, is
        maintained by Sokrates distinctly &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#7973;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; is put upon the
        same footing as &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;, which may be either &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8182;&#962; or
        &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8182;&#962;.</p>
      <p>
        When Sokrates (p. 37 B) puts the question, &#8220;You admit that &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;
        may be either &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8052;&#962; or &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#942;&#962;: how then can you argue that
        &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#942; must be always &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#942;&#962;?&#8221; the answer is, that pleasure is
        not, if we speak correctly, either true or false: neither one
        predicate nor the other is properly applicable to it: we can
        only so apply them by a metaphor, altogether misleading in
        philosophical reasoning. When Sokrates further argues (37 D),
        &#8220;You admit that some qualifying predicates may be applied to
        pleasures and pain, great or small, durable or transient,
        &amp;c. You admit that an opinion may be correct or mistaken in
        its object, and when it is the latter you call it <i>false</i>:
        why is not the pleasure which accompanies a false opinion to be
        called false also?&#8221; Protarchus refuses distinctly to admit this,
        saying, &#8220;I have already affirmed that on that supposition the <i>opinion</i>
        is false: but no man will call the <i>pleasure</i> false&#8221; (p.
        38 A).</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_32_72"></a>Plato acknowledges no truth and
        reality except in the Absolute &#8212; Pleasures which he admits to be
        true &#8212; and why.</span></p>
    <p>
      What seems present to the mind of Plato in this doctrine is the
      antithesis between the absolute and the relative. He will allow
      reality only to the absolute: the relative he considers (herein
      agreeing with the Eleates) to be all seeming and illusion. Thus
      when he comes to describe the character of those few pleasures
      which he admits to be true, we find him dwelling upon their
      absolute nature. 1. The pleasures derived from perfect geometrical
      figures: the exact straight line, square, cube, circle, &amp;c.:
      which figures are always beautiful <i>per se</i>, not by
      comparison or in relation with any thing else:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_133" href="#Footnotev3_32_133"><span
          class="sp">133</span></a> and &#8220;which have pleasures of their
      own, noway analogous to those of scratching&#8221; (<i>i. e.</i>, not
      requiring to be preceded by the discomfort of an itching surface).
      2. The pleasures derived from certain colours beautiful in
      themselves: which are beautiful always, not merely when seen in
      contrast with some other colours. 3. The pleasures of hearing
      simple sounds, beautiful in and by themselves, with whatever other
      sounds they may be connected. 4. The pleasures of sweet smells,
      which are pleasurable though not preceded by uneasiness. 5. The
      pleasures of mathematical studies: these studies do not derive
      their pleasurable character from satisfying any previous uneasy
      appetite, nor do they leave behind them any pain if they happen to
      be forgotten.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_134" href="#Footnotev3_32_134"><span

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 62 B.</p>
      <p>
        We may illustrate the doctrine of the Phil&ecirc;bus about
        pleasures and pains, by reference to a dictum of Sokrates quoted
        in the Xenophontic Memorabilia (iii. 13).</p>
      <p>
        Some person complained to Sokrates that he had lost his appetite
        &#8212; that he no longer ate with any pleasure (&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7936;&#951;&#948;&#8182;&#962; &#7956;&#963;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#953;) &#8212;
        &#8220;The physician Akumenus (so replied Sokrates) teaches us a good
        remedy in such a case. Leave off eating: after you have left
        off, you will come back into a more pleasurable, easy, and
        healthful condition.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Now let us suppose the like complaint to be addressed to the
        Platonic Sokrates. What would have been <i>his</i> answer?</p>
      <p>
        The Sokrates of the Protagoras would have regarded the
        complainant as suffering under a misfortune, and would have
        tried to suggest some remedy: either the prescription of
        Akumenus, or any other more promising that he could think of.
        The Sokrates of the Ph&aelig;don, on the contrary, would have
        congratulated him on the improvement in his condition, inasmuch
        as the misguiding and degrading ascendancy, exercised by his
        body over his mind, was suppressed in one of its most
        influential channels: just as Kephalus, in the Republic (i.
        329), is made to announce it as one of the blessings of old age,
        that the sexual appetite has left him. The Sokrates of the
        Phil&ecirc;bus, also, would have treated the case as one for
        congratulation, but he would have assigned a different reason.
        He would have replied: &#8220;The pleasures of eating are altogether
        false. You never really had any pleasure in eating. If you
        believed yourself to have any, you were under an illusion. You
        have reason to rejoice that this illusion has now passed away:
        and to rejoice the more, because you have come a step nearer to
        the most divine scheme of life.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Speusippus (the nephew and successor of Plato), if he had been
        present, would have re-assured the complainant in a manner
        equally decided. He would have said nothing, however, about the
        difference between true and false pleasures: he would have
        acknowledged them all as true, and denounced them all as
        mischievous. He would have said (see Aul. Gell. ix. 5): &#8220;The
        condition which you describe is one which I greatly envy.
        Pleasure and Pain are both, alike and equally, forms of Evil. I
        eat, to relieve the pain of hunger: but unfortunately, I cannot
        do so without experiencing some pleasure; and I thus incur evil
        in the other and opposite form. I am ashamed of this, because I
        am still kept far off from Good, or the point of neutrality: but
        I cannot help myself. <i>You</i> are more fortunate: you avert
        one evil, <i>pain</i>, without the least alloy of the other
        evil, <i>pleasure</i>: what you attain is thus pure Good. I
        hope your condition may long continue, and I should be glad to
        come into it myself.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        Not only the sincere pleasure-haters, but also other theorists
        indicated by Aristotle, would have warmly applauded this pure
        ethical doctrine of Speusippus; not from real agreement with it,
        but in order to edify the audience. They would say to one
        another aside: &#8220;This is not true; but we must do all we can to
        make people believe it. Since every one is too fond of
        pleasures, and suffers himself to be enslaved by them, we must
        pull in the contrary direction, in order that we may thereby
        bring people into the middle line.&#8221; (Aristot. Eth. Nikom. x. 1,
        1172, a. 30.)</p>
      <p>
        It deserves to be remarked that Aristotle, in alluding to these
        last theorists, disapproves their scheme of Ethical Fictions, or
        of falsifying theory in order to work upon men&#8217;s minds by
        edifying imposture; while Plato approves and employs this scheme
        in the Republic. Aristotle even recognises it as a fault in
        various persons, that they take too little delight in bodily
        pleasures &#8212; that a man is &#964;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#7991;&#959;&#962; &#7975;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7970; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;
        &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#969;&#957; (Ethic. Nikom. vii. 11, 1151, b. 24).</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page386" id="v3page386"></a>386</span>These
      few are all the varieties of pleasure which Plato admits as true:
      they are alleged as cases of the absolutely pleasurable (&#913;&#8016;&#964;&#959;-&#7969;&#948;&#973;)
      &#8212; that which is pleasurable <i>per se</i>, and always, without
      relation to any thing else, without dependence on occasion or
      circumstance, and without any antecedent or concomitant pain. All
      other pleasures are pleasurable relatively to some antecedent
      pain, or to some contrasting condition, with which they are
      compared:<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page387" id="v3page387"></a>387</span>
      accordingly Plato considers them as false, unreal, illusory:
      pleasures and not pleasures at once, and not more one than the
      other.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_135" href="#Footnotev3_32_135"><span
          class="sp">135</span></a> Herein he conforms to the Eleatic or
      Parmenidean view, according to which the relative is altogether
      falsehood and illusion: an intermediate stage between Ens and
      Non-Ens, belonging as much to the first as to the last.</p>

        Compare, respecting this Platonic view, Republic, v. pp.
        478-479, and pp. 583-585, where Plato contrasts the &#960;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8052;&#962; or
        &#947;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#942;, which arises from the acquisition of knowledge
        (when the mind nourishes itself with real essence), with the
        &#957;&#972;&#952;&#951; (p. 587 B) or &#7952;&#963;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#942;, &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#962;
        &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8134;&#962;, arising from the pursuits of wealth, power, and other
        objects of desire. </p>

        The comic poet Alexis adverts to this Platonic doctrine of the
        absolutely pleasurable, here, there, and everywhere, &#8212; &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8217; &#7969;&#948;&#8058;
        &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#962; &#7969;&#948;&#973;, &#954;&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#8150; &#954;&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#948;&#949;, Athen&aelig;. viii. 354; Meineke,
        Com. Frag. p. 453.</p>
      <p>
        In the Ph&aelig;drus (258 E), we find this same class of
        pleasures, those which cannot be enjoyed unless preceded by some
        pain, asserted to be called <i>for that reason slavish</i>
        (&#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#974;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#962;), and depreciated as worthless. Nearly all the
        pleasures connected with the body are said to belong to this
        class; but those of rhetoric and dialectic are exempted from it,
        and declared to be of superior order.</p>
      <p>
        The pleasure of gaining a victory in the stadium at Olympia was
        ranked by Greeks generally as the maximum of pleasure: and we
        find the Platonic Sokrates (Republ. v. 465 D) speaks in
        concurrence with this opinion. But this pleasure ought in
        Plato&#8217;s view to pass for a false pleasure; since it was
        invariably preceded by the most painful, long-continued
        training.</p>
      <p>
        The reasoning of Sokrates in the Phil&ecirc;bus (see especially
        pp. 46-47) against the intense and extatic pleasures, as being
        never pure, but always adulterated by accompanying pain,
        misfortune, disappointment, &amp;c., is much the same as that of
        Epikurus and his followers afterwards. The case is nowhere more
        forcibly put than in the fourth book of Lucretius (1074 seq.):
        where that poet deprecates passionate love, and points out that
        pure or unmixed pleasure belongs only to the man of sound and
        healthy reason.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_32_73"
          id="Sidenotev3_32_73"></a>Plato could not have defended this
        small list of Pleasures, upon his own admission, against his
        opponents &#8212; the Pleasure-haters, who disallowed pleasures
        altogether.</span></p>
    <p>
      The catalogue of pleasures recognised by Plato being so narrow
      (and much of them attainable only by a few persons), the amount of
      difference is really very small between him and his
      pleasure-hating opponents, who disallowed pleasure altogether. But
      small as the catalogue is, he could not consistently have defended
      it against them, upon his own principles. His opponents could have
      shown him that a considerable portion of it must be discarded, if
      we are to disallow all pleasures which are preceded by or
      intermingled with pain &#8212; or which are sometimes stronger,
      sometimes feebler, according to the relations of contrast or
      similarity with other concomitant sensations. Mathematical study
      certainly, far from being all pleasure and no pain, demands an
      irksome preparatory training (which is numbered among the <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page388" id="v3page388"></a>388</span>miseries
      of life in the Axiochus<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_136"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a>),
      succeeded by long laborious application, together with a fair
      share of vexatious puzzle and disappointment. The love of
      knowledge grows up by association (like the thirst for money or
      power), and includes an uncomfortable consciousness of ignorance:
      nay, it is precisely this painful consciousness which the Sokratic
      method was expressly intended to plant forcibly in the student&#8217;s
      mind, as an indispensable antecedent condition. Requital doubtless
      comes in time; but the outlay is not the less real, and is quite
      sufficient to disentitle the study from being counted as a true
      pleasure, in the Platonic sense. Nor could Plato, upon his own
      principles, defend the pleasures of sight, sound, and smell. For
      though he might justly contend that there were some objects
      originally agreeable to these senses, yet all these objects will
      appear more or less agreeable, according to the accompanying
      contrasts under which they are presented, while, in particular
      states of the organ, they will not appear agreeable at all. Now
      such variability of estimate is among the grounds alleged by Plato
      for declaring pleasures to be false.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_137"

        The Sokratic method, in creating consciousness of ignorance, is
        exhibited not less in the Xenophontic Memorabilia (iv. 2, 40)
        than in various Platonic dialogues, Alkibiades I.,
        The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, &amp;c. We read it formally proclaimed by

        Aristotle repeats the assertion contained in the Phil&ecirc;bus
        about the list of painless pleasures &#8212; &#7940;&#955;&#965;&#960;&#959;&#953; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#7989; &#964;&#949;
        &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054;, &amp;c. (Ethic. Nikom. x. 2, 1173, b. 16; 7, 1177,
        a. 25.) He himself says in another place (vii. 13, 1153, a. 20)
        that &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957; sometimes hurts the health, and if he had
        examined the lives of mathematicians, especially that of Kepler,
        he would hardly have imagined that mathematical investigations
        have no pains attached to them. He probably means that they are
        not preceded by painful appetites such as hunger and thirst. But
        they are preceded by acquired impulses or desires, which in
        reference to the present question are upon same footing as the
        natural appetites. A healthy and temperate man, leading a
        regular life and in easy circumstances, knows little of hunger
        and thirst as pains: he knows them only as appetites which give
        relish to his periodical meals. It is only when this periodical
        satisfaction is withheld that his appetite grows to a painful
        and distressing height. So too the &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#962;; his appetite for
        study, when regularly gratified to an extent consistent with
        health and other considerations, is not painful; but it will
        rise to the height of a most distressing privation if he be
        debarred from gratifying it, excluded from books and papers,
        disturbed by noises and intrusions. Kepler, if interdicted from
        pursuing his calculations, would have been miserable. Jason of
        Pher&aelig; was heard to say that he felt hungry so long as he
        was not in possession of supreme power &#8212; &#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8135;&#957;, &#8005;&#964;&#949; &#956;&#8052;
        &#964;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#8150;, Aristot. Politic. iii. 4, 1277, a. 24; thus intimating
        that the acquired appetite of ambition had in his mind reached
        the same intensity as the natural appetite of hunger.</p>

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 41-42. In the Ph&aelig;don (p. 60 B)

    <p>
      How little the Sokrates of this dialogue differs, at the bottom,
      from the fastidious pleasure-haters, may be seen by the passage in
      which he proclaims that the life of intelligence alone, without
      the smallest intermixture of pleasure or pain, is the really
      perfect life: that the Gods and the divine Kosmos have no
      enjoyment and no suffering.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_138"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a> The
      emotional department of human nature is here regarded as a
      degenerate and obstructive appendage: so that it was an
      inauspicious act of the sons of the Demiurgus (in the Tim&aelig;us<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_139" href="#Footnotev3_32_139"><span
          class="sp">139</span></a>) when they attached the spherical
      head (the miniature parallel of the Kosmos, with the rotatory
      movements of the immortal soul in the brain within) at the summit
      of a bodily trunk and limbs, containing the thoracic and abdominal
      cavities: the thoracic cavity embodying a second and inferior soul
      with the energetic emotions and passions &#8212; the abdominal region
      serving as lodgment to a third yet baser soul with the appetites.
      From this conjunction sprang the corrupting influence of emotional
      impulse, depriving man of his close parallelism with the Kosmos,
      and poisoning the life of pure exclusive Intelligence &#8212; regular,
      unfeeling, undisturbed. The Pleasure-haters, together with
      Speusippus and others, declared that pleasure and pain were both
      alike enemies to be repelled, and that neutrality was the
      condition to be aimed at.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_140"

        fundamental idea though embodied in a different illustration,

        a period of imprisonment, to which the immortal rational soul is
        condemned, in a corrupt and defective body, with perpetual
        stream of disturbing sensations and emotions (Ph&aelig;don, pp.

        To whom does Plato here make allusion, under the general title
        of the Fastidious (&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;) Pleasure-haters? Schleiermacher
        (note to his translation, p. 487), Stallbaum, and most critics
        down to Dr. Badham inclusive, are of opinion, that he alludes to
        Antisthenes &#8212; among whose <i>dicta</i> we certainly read
        declarations expressing positive aversion to pleasure &#8212; &#956;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#951;&#957;
        &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7970; &#7969;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#951;&#957; Diog. L. vi. 3; compare ix. 101, and
        Winckelmann, Frag. Antisthen. xii. Mr. Poste, on the contrary,
        thinks it improbable that Antisthenes is alluded to (see p. 80
        of his Phil&ecirc;bus). I confess that I think so too. Mr. Poste
        points out that these &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962; are characterised by Plato (p.
        44 B), as &#956;&#940;&#955;&#945; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957;:&#8212; whereas we are
        informed that speculations on &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; were neglected by
        Antisthenes, who confined his attention to &#964;&#8048; &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#940;. This is a
        strong reason for believing that Antisthenes cannot be here
        meant; and there are some other reasons also.</p>
      <p>
        First, in describing the &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, Plato notes it as one among
        their attributes, that they <i>hold in thorough detestation the
          indecorous pleasures</i> (&#964;&#8048;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#940;&#962;, &#7939;&#962; &#959;&#8019;&#962;
        &#949;&#7988;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#956;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8182;&#962;, p. 46 A). Now this is surely
        not likely to have been affirmed about Antisthenes. It was the
        conspicuous characteristic of the Cynic sect, begun by
        Antisthenes, and carried still farther by his pupil Diogenes,
        that they reduced to its minimum the distinction between the
        decorous and the indecorous.</p>
      <p>
        Next, we may observe that these &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, whoever they were,
        are spoken of with much respect by Plato, even while he combats
        their doctrine (p. 44 C). I think it not likely that he would
        have spoken thus of Antisthenes. We are told that there
        prevailed between the two a great and reciprocal acrimony. And
        this sentiment is manifested in the Sophist&ecirc;s (p. 251 B),
        where the opponents whom Plato is refuting are described with
        the most contemptuous bitterness &#8212; and where Schleiermacher, and
        the critics generally, declare that he alludes to Antisthenes.
        The passage in the Sophist&ecirc;s represents, in my judgment,
        the probable sentiment of Plato towards Antisthenes: the passage
        in the Phil&ecirc;bus is at variance with it.</p>
      <p>
        I imagine that the &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962; to whom Plato makes allusion in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus, are the persons from whom his nephew and
        successor Speusippus derived the doctrine declared in the first
        portion of this note. The &#8220;vetus omnia Academia&#8221; of Aulus
        Gellius is an exaggerated phrase; but many of the old Academy,
        or companions of Plato, probably held the theory that pleasure
        was only one form of evil, &#8212; especially the pythagorising <i>Platonici</i>,
        adopting the tendencies of Plato himself in his old age. That
        Speusippus was among the borrowers from the Pythagoreans, we
        know from Aristotle (Eth. Nikom. i. 4, 1096, b. 8).</p>
      <p>
        Now the Pythagorean canon of life, like the Orphic (both of them
        supposed by Herodotus to be derived in great part from Egypt &#8212;
        ii. 81), was distinguished by a multiplicity of abstinences,
        disgusts, antipathies, in respect to alimentation and other
        physical circumstances of life &#8212; which were held to be of the
        most imperative force and necessity; so that offences against
        them were of all others the most intolerable. A remarkable
        fragment of the &#922;&#961;&#8134;&#964;&#949;&#962; of Euripides (ed. Dind., vol. ii. p. 912)
        describes a variety of this <i>purism</i> analogous to the
        Orphic and Pythagorean:&#8212; &#928;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#945; &#948;&#8217; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#7988;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, &#966;&#949;&#973;&#947;&#969; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#957;

      <p>
        It appears to me that the &#948;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, to whom Plato alludes in
        the Phil&ecirc;bus, were most probably pythagorising friends of
        his own; who, adopting a ritual of extreme rigour, distinguished
        themselves by the violence of their antipathies towards &#964;&#8048;&#962;
        &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8048;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957;. Plato speaks of them with respect;
        partly because ethical theorists, who denounce <i>pleasure</i>,
        are usually characterised in reverential terms, as persons of
        exalted principle, even by those who think their reasonings
        inconclusive; partly because these men only pushed the
        consequences of Plato&#8217;s own reasonings, rather farther than
        Plato himself did. In fact they were more consistent than Plato
        was: for the principles laid down in the Phil&ecirc;bus, if
        carried out strictly, would go to the exclusion of all pleasures
        &#8212; not less of the few which he tolerates, than of the many which
        he banishes.</p>
      <p>
        These pythagorising <i>Platonici</i> might well be termed
        &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8054; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957;. They paid much attention to the
        interpretation of nature, though they did so according to a
        numerical and geometrical symbolism.</p>

    <p>
      In my judgment, this is one main defect pervading the Platonic
      Phil&ecirc;bus &#8212; the forced conjunction between Kosmology and
      Ethics &#8212; the violent pressure employed to force Pleasures and
      Pains into the same classifying framework as cognitive Beliefs &#8212;
      the true and the false. In respect to the various pleasures, the
      dialogue contains many excellent remarks, the value of which is
      diminished by the purpose to which they are turned.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_142" href="#Footnotev3_32_142"><span
          class="sp">142</span></a> One of Plato&#8217;s main batteries is
      directed against the intense, extatic, momentary enjoyments, which
      he sets in contrast against the gentle, serene, often renewable.<a

          class="sp">143</span></a> That the former are often
      purchasable only at the cost of a distempered condition of body
      and mind, which ought to render them objects shunned rather than
      desired by a reasonable man &#8212; this is a doctrine important to
      inculcate: but nothing is gained by applying the metaphorical
      predicate <i>false</i>, either to them, or to the other classes
      of mixed pleasures, &amp;c., which Plato discountenances under the
      same epithet. By thus condemning pleasures in wholesale and in
      large groups, we not only set aside the innocuous as well as
      others, but we also leave unapplied, or only half applied, that
      principle of Measure or Calculation which Plato so often extols as
      the main item in Summum Bonum.</p>

        We read in Campbell&#8217;s Philosophy of Rhetoric (Book i. ch. 7, pp.
        168-170) some very good remarks on the erroneous and equivocal
        assertions which identify Truth and Good &#8212; a thesis on which
        various Platonists have expended much eloquence. Dr. Campbell
        maintains the just distinction between the Emotions and Will on
        one side, and the Understanding on the other.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Passion&#8221; (he says) &#8220;is the mover to action, Reason is the

        how explained and applied in the Protagoras.</span></p>
    <p>
      In this dialogue as well as others, Measure is thus exalted, and
      exalted with emphasis, at the final conclusion: but it is far less
      clearly and systematically applied, as far as human beings are
      concerned, than in the Protagoras. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page392" id="v3page392"></a>392</span>The Sokrates of
      the Protagoras does not recognise any pleasures as false &#8212; nor any
      class of pleasures as absolutely unmixed with pain: he does not
      set pleasure in pointed opposition to the avoidance of pain, nor
      the intense momentary pleasures to the gentle and more durable. He
      considers that the whole course of life is a perpetual
      intermixture of pleasures and pains, in proportions variable and
      to a certain extent modifiable: that each item in both lists has
      its proper value, commensurable with the others; that the purpose
      of a well-ordered life consists, in rendering the total sum of
      pleasure as great, and the total sum of pain as small, as each
      man&#8217;s case admits: that avoidance of pain and attainment of
      pleasure are co-ordinate branches of this one comprehensive End.
      He farther declares that men are constantly liable to err by false
      remembrances, estimates, and comparisons, of pleasures and pains
      past &#8212; by false expectations of pleasures and pains to come: that
      the whole security of life lies in keeping clear of such error &#8212;
      in right comparison of these items and right choice between them:
      that therefore the full sovereign controul of each man&#8217;s life must
      be vested in the Measuring Science or Calculating Intelligence.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_144" href="#Footnotev3_32_144"><span
          class="sp">144</span></a> Not only all comprehensive
      sovereignty, but also ever-active guidance, is postulated for this
      Measuring Science: while at the same time its special function,
      and the items to which it applies, are more clearly defined than
      in any other Platonic dialogue. If a man be so absorbed by the
      idea of an intense momentary pleasure or pain, as to forget or
      disregard <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page393"
          id="v3page393"></a>393</span>accompaniments or consequences of
      an opposite nature, greatly overbalancing it &#8212; this is an error
      committed from default of the Measuring Science: but it is only
      one among many errors arising from the like deficiency. Nothing is
      required but the Measuring Science or Intelligence, to enable a
      man to make the best of those circumstances in which he may be
      placed: this is true of all men, under every variety of place and
      circumstances. Measure is not the Good, but the one condition
      which is constant as well as indispensable to any tolerable
      approach towards Good.</p>

      <p>
        Yet Plato in the Phil&ecirc;bus, imputing to the Hedonistic
        theory that it sets aside all idea of measure, regulation,
        limit, advances as an argument in the case, that Pleasure and
        Pain in their own nature have no limit (Phil&ecirc;bus, pp.
        25-26 B, 27 E. Compare Dr. Badham&#8217;s note, p. 30 of his edition).</p>
      <p>
        The imputation is unfounded, and the argument without
        application, in regard to the same theory as expounded by
        Sokrates in the Protagoras.</p>
      <p>
        At the end of the Phil&ecirc;bus (p. 67 B) Plato makes Sokrates
        exclaim, &#8220;We cannot put Pleasure first among the items of Good,
        even though all oxen, horses, and other beasts affirm it&#8221;. This
        rhetorical flourish is altogether misplaced in the
        Phil&ecirc;bus: for Plato had already specified it as one of the
        conditions of the Good, That it must be acceptable and must give
        satisfaction to all animals, and even to all plants (pp. 22 B,
        60 C), as well as to men.</p>

        statement to what items it is applied.</span></p>
    <p>
      In the Phil&ecirc;bus, too, Measure &#8212; The Exact Quantum &#8212; The
      Exact Moment &#8212; are proclaimed as the chief item in the complex
      called &#8212; The Good.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_145"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a> But to
      what Items does Sokrates intend the measure to be applied? Not
      certainly to pleasures: the comparison of quantity between one
      pleasure and another is discarded as useless or misleading, and
      the comparison of quality alone is admitted &#8212; <i>i. e.</i>, true
      and false: the large majority of human pleasures being repudiated
      in the lump as false, and a small remnant only being tolerated, on
      the allegation that they are true. Nor, again, is the measure
      applied to pains: for though Plato affirms that a life altogether
      without pains (as without pleasures) would be the truly divine
      Ideal, yet he never tells us that the Measuring Intelligence is to
      be made available in the comparison and choice of pains, and in
      avoidance of the greater by submitting to the less. Lastly, when
      we look at the concession made in this dialogue to Gorgias and his
      art, we find that Plato no longer claims for his Good or Measure
      any directive function, or any paramount influence, as to utility,
      profit, reputation, or the greater ends which men usually pursue
      in life:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_146" href="#Footnotev3_32_146"><span
          class="sp">146</span></a> he claims for it only the privilege
      of satisfying the aspiration for truth, in minds wherein such

    <p>
      Comparing the Phil&ecirc;bus with the Protagoras, therefore, we
      see that though, in both, Measuring Science or Intelligence is
      proclaimed as supreme, the province assigned to it in the
      Phil&ecirc;bus is comparatively narrow. Moreover the practical
      side or activities of life (which are prominent in the Protagoras)
      appear in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page394"
          id="v3page394"></a>394</span>the Phil&ecirc;bus thrust into a
      corner; where scanty room is found for them on ground nearly
      covered by the speculative, or theorising, truth-seeking,
      pursuits. Practical reason is forced into the same categories as
      theoretical.</p>
    <p>
      The classification of <i>true</i> and <i>false</i> is (as I have
      already remarked) unsuitable for pleasures and pains. We have now
      to see how Plato applies it to cognitions, to which it really
      belongs. </p>

        how Plato applies it to Cognitions.</span></p>
    <p>
      The highest of these Cognitions is set apart as Dialectic or
      Ontology: the Object of which is, Ens or Entia, eternal, ever the
      same and unchangeable, ever unmixed with each other: while the
      corresponding Subject is, Reason, Intelligence, Wisdom, by which
      it is apprehended and felt. In this Science alone reside perfect
      Truth and Purity. Where the Objects are shifting, variable, mixed
      or confounded together, there Reason cannot apply herself; no pure
      or exact truth can be attained.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_147"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a> These

    <p>
      Though pure truth belongs exclusively to Dialectic and to the
      Objects thereof, there are other Sciences which, having more or
      less of affinity to Dialectic, may thus be classified according to
      the degree of such affinity. Mathematics approach most nearly to
      Dialectic. Under Mathematics are included the Sciences or Arts of
      numbering, measuring, weighing &#8212; Arithmetic, Metr&ecirc;tic,
      Static &#8212; which are applied to various subordinate arts, and impart
      to these latter all the scientific guidance and certainty which is
      found in them. Without Arithmetic, the subordinate arts would be
      little better than vague guesswork or knack. But Plato
      distinguishes two varieties of Arithmetic and Metr&ecirc;tic: one
      purely theoretical, prosecuted by philosophers, and adapted to
      satisfy the love of abstract truth &#8212; the other applied to some
      department of practice, and employed by the artist as a guide to
      the execution of his work. Theoretical Arithmetic is characterised
      by this feature, that it assumes each unit to be equal, like, <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page395" id="v3page395"></a>395</span>and
      interchangeable with every other unit: while practical Arithmetic
      adds together concrete realities, whether like and equal to each
      other or not.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_148" href="#Footnotev3_32_148"><span

    <p>
      It is thus that the theoretical geometer and arithmetician, though
      not coming up to the full and pure truth of Dialectic, is
      nevertheless nearer to it than the carpenter or the ship-builder,
      who apply the measure to material objects. But the carpenter,
      ship-builder, architect, &amp;c., do really apply measure, line,
      rule, &amp;c.: they are therefore nearer to truth than other
      artists, who apply no measure at all. To this last category belong
      the musical composer, the physician, the husbandman, the pilot,
      the military commander, neither of whom can apply to their
      processes either numeration or measurement: all of them are forced
      to be contented with vague estimate, conjecture, a practised eye
      and ear.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_149" href="#Footnotev3_32_149"><span

        classification &#8212; difference with other dialogues.</span></p>
    <p>
      The foregoing classification of Sciences and Arts is among the
      most interesting points in the Phil&ecirc;bus. It coincides to a
      great degree with that which we read in the sixth and seventh
      books of the Republic, though it is also partially different: it
      differs too in some respects from doctrines advanced in other
      dialogues. Thus we find here (in the Phil&ecirc;bus) that the
      science or art of the physician, the pilot, the general, &amp;c.,
      is treated as destitute of measure and as an aggregate of
      unscientific guesses: whereas in the Gorgias<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_150" href="#Footnotev3_32_150"><span
          class="sp">150</span></a> and elsewhere, these are extolled as
      genuine arts, and are employed to discredit Rhetoric by contrast.
      Again, all these arts are here placed lower in the scientific
      scale than the occupations of the carpenter or the ship-builder,
      who possess and use some material measures. But these latter, in
      the Republic,<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_151" href="#Footnotev3_32_151"><span
          class="sp">151</span></a> are dismissed with the disparaging
      epithet of snobbish (&#946;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#953;) and deemed unworthy of

      Dialectic appears here exalted to the same pre-eminence which is
      assigned to it in the Republic &#8212; as the energy of the pure
      Intellect, dealing with those permanent real Essences which are
      the objects of Intellect alone, intelligible only and not visible.
      The distinction here drawn by Plato between the theoretical and <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page396" id="v3page396"></a>396</span>practical
      arithmetic and geometry, compared with numeration or mensuration
      of actual objects of sense &#8212; is also remarkable in two ways:
      first, as it marks his departure from the historical Sokrates, who
      recognised the difference between the two, but discountenanced the
      theoretical as worthless:<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_152"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a> next
      as it brings clearly to view, the fundamental assumption or
      hypothesis upon which abstract arithmetic proceeds &#8212; the concept
      of units all perfectly like and equal. That this <i>is</i> an
      assumption (always departing more or less from the facts of sense)
      &#8212; and that upon its being conceded depends the peculiar certainty
      and accuracy of arithmetical calculation &#8212; was an observation
      probably then made for the first time; and not unnecessary to be
      made even now, since it is apt to escape attention. It is
      enunciated clearly both here and in the Republic.<a

        Xenophon, Memorab. iv. 7, 2-8. The contrast drawn in this
        chapter of the Memorabilia appears to me to coincide pretty
        exactly with that which is taken in the Phil&ecirc;bus, though
        the preference is reversed. Dr. Badham (p. 78) and Mr. Poste
        (pp. 106-113) consider Plato as pointing to a contrast between
        pure and applied Mathematics: which I do not understand to be
        his meaning. The distinction taken by Aristotle in the passage
        cited by Mr. Poste is different, and does really designate Pure
        and Applied Mathematics. Mr. Poste would have found a better
        comparison in Ethic. Nikom. i. 7, 1098, a. 29.</p>

        Mr. John Stuart Mill thus calls attention to the same remark in
        his instructive chapters on Demonstration and Necessary Truth
        (System of Logic, Book ii. ch. vi sect. 3). </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The inductions of Arithmetic are of two sorts: first, those
        that we have just expounded, such as One and One are Two, Two
        and One are Three, &amp;c., which may be called the definitions
        of the various numbers, in the improper or geometrical sense of
        the word Definition; and, secondly, the two following Axioms.
        The sums of Equals are equal, the differences of Equals are
        equal.</p>
      <p>
        &#8220;These axioms, and likewise the so-called Definitions, are (as
        already shown) results of induction: true of all objects
        whatsoever, and as it may seem, exactly true, without the
        hypothetical assumption of unqualified truth where an
        approximation to it is all that exists. On more accurate
        investigation, however, it will be found that even in this case,
        there is one hypothetical element in the ratiocination. In all
        propositions concerning numbers a condition is implied without
        which none of them would be true, and that condition is an
        assumption which may be false. The condition is that 1 = 1: that
        all the numbers are numbers of the same or of equal units. Let
        this be doubtful, and not one of the propositions in arithmetic
        will hold true. How can we know that one pound and one pound
        make two pounds, if one of the pounds may be troy and the other
        avoirdupois? They may not make two pounds of either or of any
        weight. How can we know that a forty-horse power is always equal
        to itself, unless we assume that all horses are of equal
        strength? One actual pound weight is not exactly equal to
        another, nor one mile&#8217;s length to another; a nicer balance or
        more exact measuring instruments would always detect some
        difference.&#8221;</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The long preliminary discussion of the Phil&ecirc;bus thus brings
      us to the conclusion &#8212; That a descending scale of value,
      relatively to truth and falsehood, must be recognised in
      cognitions as well as in pleasures: many cognitions are not
      entirely true, but tainted in different degrees by error and
      falsehood: most pleasures also, instead of being true and pure,
      are alloyed by concomitant pains or delusions or both: moreover,
      all the intense <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page397"
          id="v3page397"></a>397</span>pleasures are incompatible with
      Measure, or a fixed standard,<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_154"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_154"><span class="sp">154</span></a> and
      must therefore be excluded from the category of Good.</p>

      imperfectly. </p>
    <p>
      1. Measure; that which conforms to Measure and to proper season:
      with everything else analogous, which we can believe to be of
      eternal nature. &#8212; These seem to be unchangeable Forms or Ideas,
      which are here considered objectively, apart from any percipient
      Subject affected by them.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_155"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_155"><span class="sp">155</span></a></p>

      2. The Symmetrical, Beautiful, Perfect, Sufficient, &amp;c. &#8212;
      These words seem to denote the successive manifestations of the
      same afore-mentioned attributes; but considered both objectively
      and subjectively, as affecting and appreciated by some percipient.</p>
    <p>
      3. Intelligent or Rational Mind &#8212; Here the Subject is brought in
      by itself.</p>
    <p>
      4. Sciences, Cognitions, Arts, Right Opinions, &amp;c. &#8212; Here we <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page398" id="v3page398"></a>398</span>have
      the intellectual manifestations of the Subject, but of a character
      inferior to No. 3, descending in the scale of value relatively to
      truth.</p>
    <p>
      5. Lastly come the small list of true and painless pleasures. &#8212;
      These, being not intellectual at all, but merely emotional (some
      as accompaniments of intellectual, others of sensible, processes),
      are farther removed from Good and Measure than even No. 4 &#8212; the
      opining or uncertain phases of the intellect.<a

      for the Kosmos has an intelligent soul. The fifth marks the

        Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 66 A.</p>
      <p>
        The Appendix B, subjoined by Mr. Poste to his edition of the
        Phil&ecirc;bus (pp. 149-165), is a very valuable Dissertation,
        comparing and explaining the abstract theories of Plato and
        Aristotle. He remarks, justly contrasting the Phil&ecirc;bus
        with the Tim&aelig;us, as to the doctrine of Limit: &#8220;In the
        Phil&ecirc;bus the limit is always quantitative. Quality,
        including all the elementary forces, is the substratum that has
        to receive the quantitative determination. Just, however, as
        Quality underlies quantity, we can conceive a substratum
        underlying quality. This Plato in the Tim&aelig;us calls the
        Vehicle or Receptacle (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;), and Aristotle in his
        writings the primary Matter (&#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#8021;&#955;&#951;). The Phil&ecirc;bus,
        however, does not carry the analysis so far. It regards quality
        as the ultimate matter, the substratum to be moulded and
        measured out in due quantity by the quantitative limit&#8221; (p.
        160).</p>
      <p>
        I doubt whether the Platonic idea of &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; is rightly
        expressed by Mr. Poste&#8217;s translation &#8212; a <i>mean</i> (p. 158).
        It rather implies, even in Politikus, p. 306, to which he
        refers, something adjusted according to a positive standard or
        conformable to an assumed measure or perfection: there being
        undoubtedly error in excess above it and error in defect below
        it &#8212; but the standard being not necessarily mid-way between the
        two. The Pythagoreans used &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#962; in a very large sense,
        describing it as the First Cause of Good. Proklus ad Plat.

        16-23), nor the Prolegomena of Stallbaum (pp. 76-77 seq.),
        succeed in making this obscure close of the Phil&ecirc;bus
        clearly intelligible. Stallbaum, after indicating many
        commentators who have preceded him, observes respecting the
        explanations which they have given: &#8220;Ea sunt adeo varia atque
        inter se diversa, ut tanquam advers&acirc; fronte inter ipsa
        pugnare dicenda sint&#8221; (p. 72).</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I see no sufficient ground for the hypothesis of Stallbaum and
      some other critics, who, considering the last result abrupt and
      unsatisfactory, suspect that Plato either intended to add more, or
      did add more which has not come down to us.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_32_157" href="#Footnotev3_32_157"><span
          class="sp">157</span></a> Certainly the result (as in many
      other Platonic dialogues) is inconsiderable, and the instruction
      derivable from the dialogue must be picked out by the reader
      himself from the long train of antecedent reasoning. The special
      point emphatically brought out at the end is the discredit thrown
      upon the intense pleasures, and the exclusion of them from the
      list of constituents of Good. If among Plato&#8217;s contemporaries who
      advocated the Hedonistic doctrine, there were any who laid their
      main stress upon these intense pleasures, he may be considered to
      have replied to them under the name of Phil&ecirc;bus. But
      certainly this result might have been attained with a smaller
      array of preliminaries.</p>

        and the Ph&aelig;drus, and Symposion, in respect to Pulchrum,
        and intense Emotions generally.</span></p>
    <p>
      Moreover, in regard to these same intense emotions we have to
      remark that Plato in other dialogues holds a very different
      opinion respecting them &#8212; or at least respecting some of them. We
      have seen that at the close of the Phil&ecirc;bus he connects
      Bonum and Pulchrum principally, and almost exclusively, with the
      Reason; but we find him, in the Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion,
      taking <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page399" id="v3page399"></a>399</span>a
      different, indeed an opposite, view of the matter; and presenting
      Bonum and Pulchrum as objects, not of the unimpassioned and
      calculating Reason, but of ardent aspiration and even of extatic
      love. Reason is pronounced to be insufficient for attaining them,
      and a peculiar vein of inspiration a species of madness, <i>eo
        nomine</i> &#8212; is postulated in its place. The life of the
      philosophical aspirant is compared to that of the passionate
      lover, beginning at first with attachment to some beautiful youth,
      and rising by a gradual process of association, so as to transfer
      the same fervent attachment to his mental companionship, as a
      stimulus for generating intellectual sympathies and recollections
      of the world of Ideas. He is represented as experiencing in the
      fullest measure those intense excitements and disturbances which
      Eros alone can provoke.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_158"
        href="#Footnotev3_32_158"><span class="sp">158</span></a> It is
      true that Plato here repudiates sensual excitements. In this
      respect the Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion agree with the
      Phil&ecirc;bus. But as between Reason and Emotion, they disagree
      with it altogether: for they dwell upon ideal excitements of the
      most vehement character. They describe the highest perfection of
      human nature as growing out of the better variety of madness &#8212; out
      of the glowing inspirations of Eros: a state replete with the most
      intense alternating emotions of pain and pleasure. How opposite is
      the tone of Sokrates in the Phil&ecirc;bus, where he denounces all
      the intense pleasures as belonging to a distempered condition &#8212; as
      adulterated with pain, and as impeding the tranquil process of
      Reason &#8212; and where he tolerates only such gentle pleasures as are
      at once unmixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page400"
          id="v3page400"></a>400</span> with pain and easily controuled
      by Reason! In the Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion, we are told that
      Bonum and Pulchrum are attainable only under the stimulus of Eros,
      through a process of emotion, feverish and extatic, with mingled
      pleasure and pain: and that they crown such aspirations, if
      successfully prosecuted, with an emotional recompense, or with
      pleasure so intense as to surpass all other pleasures. In the
      Phil&ecirc;bus, Bonum and Pulchrum come before us as measure,
      proportion, seasonableness: as approachable only through tranquil
      Reason &#8212; addressing their ultimate recompense to Reason alone &#8212;
      excluding both vehement agitations and intense pleasures &#8212; and
      leaving only a corner of the mind for gentle and unmixed
      pleasures.<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_159" href="#Footnotev3_32_159"><span

        See in the Symposion the doctrines of the prophetess Diotima, as
        recited by Sokrates, pp. 204-212: also the Ph&aelig;drus, the
        second &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#974;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#957; delivered by Sokrates upon Eros, pp. 36-60,
        repeated briefly and confirmed by Sokrates, pp. 77-78.</p>
      <p>
        Compare these with the latter portion of the Phil&ecirc;bus; the
        difference of spirit and doctrine will appear very manifest. </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate the contrast between the Ph&aelig;drus and the
        Phil&ecirc;bus, we may observe that the former compares the
        excitement and irritation of the inspired soul when its wings
        are growing to ascend to Bonum and Pulchrum, with the &#954;&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#953;&#962; or
        irritation of the gums when a child is cutting teeth &#8212; &#950;&#949;&#8150; &#959;&#8022;&#957;

        the strong metaphors used by Plato to describe the emotional
        condition of the mind during its fervour of aspiration towards
        Bonum and Pulchrum. On the other hand, in the Phil&ecirc;bus,
        &#954;&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#953;&#962; and &#947;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; are noted as manifestations of that
        distempered condition which produces indeed moments of intense
        pleasure, but is quite inconsistent with Reason and the
        attainment of Good. See Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 46 E, 51 D, and
        Gorgias, p. 494.</p>

      The comparison, here made, of the Phil&ecirc;bus with the
      Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion, is one among many proofs of the
      different points of view with which Plato, in his different
      dialogues,<a name="FnAnchorv3_32_160" href="#Footnotev3_32_160"><span
          class="sp">160</span></a> handled the same topics of ethical
      and psychological discussion. And upon this point of dissent,
      Eudoxus and Epikurus, would have agreed with the Sokrates of the
      Phil&ecirc;bus, in deprecating that extatic vein of emotion which
      is so greatly extolled in the Ph&aelig;drus and Symposion.</p>

    <p>
      <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; What have you been doing at the Senate-house,
      Menexenus? You probably think that your course of education and
      philosophy is finished, and that you are qualified for high
      political functions. Young as you are, you aim at exercising
      command over us elders, as your family have always done before
      you.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_1" href="#Footnotev3_33_1"><span
          class="sp">1</span></a> <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; I shall do so, if you
      advise and allow me, Sokrates: but not otherwise. Now, however, I
      came to learn who was the person chosen by the Senate to deliver
      the customary oration at the approaching public funeral of the
      citizens who have fallen in battle. The Senate, however, have
      adjourned the election until to-morrow: but I think either
      Archinus or Dion will be chosen. <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; To die in battle
      is a fine thing in many ways.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_2"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He who
      dies thus may be poor, but he receives a splendid funeral: he may
      be of little worth, yet he is still praised in prepared speeches
      by able orators, who decorate his name with brilliant encomiums,
      whether deserved or not, fascinating all the hearers: extolling us
      all &#8212; not merely the slain warrior, but the city collectively, our
      ancestors, and us the living &#8212; so admirably that I stand bewitched
      when I hear them, and fancy myself a <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page402" id="v3page402"></a>402</span>greater, nobler,
      and finer man than I was before. I am usually accompanied by some
      strangers, who admire as much as I do, and who conceive a lofty
      estimation both of me and of the city. The voice of the orator
      resounds in my ear, and the feeling of pride dwells in my mind,
      for more than three days; during which interval I fancy myself
      almost in the islands of the blest. I hardly come to myself or
      recollect where I am, until the fourth or fifth day. Such is the
      force of these orators.</p>

      <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; You are always deriding the orators, Sokrates.<a

      However, on this occasion I think the orator chosen will have
      little chance of success: he will have no time for preparation,
      and will be obliged to speak <i>impromptu</i>. <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212;
      Never fear: each of these orators has harangues ready prepared.
      Besides, there is no difficulty here in speaking <i>impromptu</i>.
      If indeed the purpose were to praise the Athenians in
      Peloponnesus, or the Peloponnesians at Athens, an excellent orator
      would be required to persuade or to give satisfaction. But when he
      exhibits before the very hearers whom he praises, there is no
      great difficulty in appearing to be a good speaker.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_4" href="#Footnotev3_33_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
      <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; Indeed! What! do you think you would be competent
      to deliver the harangue yourself, if the Senate were to elect you?
      <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; Certainly: and it is no wonder that I should be
      competent to speak, because I have learnt rhetoric from Aspasia
      (an excellent mistress, who has taught many eminent speakers, and
      among them Perikles, the most illustrious of all), and the harp
      from Konnus. But any one else, even less well-trained than me &#8212;
      instructed in music by Lamprus, and in rhetoric by Antiphon &#8212;
      would still be fully competent to succeed in praising Athenians
      among Athenians. <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; What would you have to say, if
      the duty were imposed upon you?<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_5"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i>
      &#8212; Probably little or nothing of my own. But it was only yesterday
      that I heard Aspasia going through a funeral harangue for this
      very occasion: partly suggestions of the present moment, partly
      recollections of past matters which had <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page403" id="v3page403"></a>403</span>occurred to her
      when she composed the funeral harangue delivered by Perikles. <i>Menex.</i>
      &#8212; Could you recollect what Aspasia said? <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; I should
      be much to blame if I could not. I learnt it from herself, and was
      near being beaten because I partly forgot it. <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; Why
      do you not proceed with it then? <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; I fear that my
      instructress would be displeased, if I were to publish her
      discourse. <i>Menex.</i> &#8212; Do not fear that, but proceed to
      speak. You will confer the greatest pleasure upon me, whether what
      you say comes from Aspasia or from any one else. Only proceed. <i>Sokr.</i>
      &#8212; But perhaps you will laugh me to scorn, if I, an elderly man,
      continue still such work of pastime.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_6"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> <i>Menex.</i>
      &#8212; Not at all: I beseech you to speak. <i>Sokr.</i> &#8212; Well, I
      cannot refuse you. Indeed, I could hardly refuse, if you requested
      me to strip naked and dance &#8212; since we are here alone.<a

        harangues. Many such harangues existed at Athens, composed by
        distinguished orators or logographers &#8212; Established type of the
        harangue.</span></p>
    <p>
      It had been long the received practice among the Athenians to
      honour their fallen warriors from time to time by this sort of
      public funeral, celebrated with every demonstration of mournful
      respect: and to appoint one of the ablest and most dignified
      citizens as public orator on the occasion.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_10" href="#Footnotev3_33_10"><span
          class="sp">10</span></a> The discourse delivered by Perikles,
      as appointed orator, at the end of the first Peloponnesian war,
      has been immortalised by Thucydides, and stands as one of the most
      impressive remnants of Hellenic antiquity. Since the occasion
      recurred pretty often, and since the orator chosen was always a
      man already conspicuous,<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_11"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> we may
      be sure that there existed in the time of Plato many funeral
      harangues which are now lost: indeed he himself says in this
      dialogue, that distinguished politicians prepared such harangues
      beforehand, in case the choice of the citizens should fall upon
      them. And we may farther be sure, amidst the active cultivation of
      rhetoric at Athens &#8212; that the rhetorical teachers as well as their
      pupils, and the logographers or paid composers of speeches, were
      practised in this variety of oratorical compositions not less than
      in others. We have one of them among the remaining discourses of
      the logographer Lysias: who could not actually have delivered it
      himself (since he was not even a citizen) &#8212; nor could ever
      probably have been called upon to prepare one for delivery (since
      the citizens chosen were always eminent speakers and politicians
      themselves, not requiring the aid of a logographer) &#8212; but who
      composed it as a rhetorical exercise to extend his own celebrity.
      In like manner we find <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page405"
          id="v3page405"></a>405</span>one among the discourses of
      Demosthenes, though of very doubtful authenticity. The funeral
      discourse had thus come to acquire an established type. Rhetorical
      teachers had collected and generalised, out of the published
      harangues before them, certain <i>loci communes</i>, religious,
      patriotic, social, historical or pseudo-historical, &amp;c.,
      suitable to be employed by any new orator.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_12" href="#Footnotev3_33_12"><span
          class="sp">12</span></a> All such <i>loci</i> were of course
      framed upon the actual sentiments prevalent among the majority of
      Athenians; furnishing eloquent expression for sympathies and
      antipathies deeply lodged in every one&#8217;s bosom.</p>

    <p>
      The funeral discourse which we read in the Menexenus is framed
      upon this classical model. It dwells, with emphasis and elegance,
      upon the patriotic common-places which formed the theme of rhetors
      generally. Plato begins by extolling the indigenous character of
      the Athenian population; not immigrants from abroad (like the
      Peloponnesians), but born from the very soil of Attica:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_13" href="#Footnotev3_33_13"><span
          class="sp">13</span></a> which, at a time when other parts of
      the earth produced nothing but strange animals and plants, gave
      birth to an admirable breed of men, as well as to wheat and barley
      for their nourishment, and to the olive for assisting their bodily
      exercises.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_14" href="#Footnotev3_33_14"><span
          class="sp">14</span></a> Attica was from the beginning
      favoured by the Gods; and the acropolis had been an object of
      competition between Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Poseidon.<a

          class="sp">15</span></a> She was the common and equal mother
      of all the citizens, who, from such community of birth and purity
      of Hellenic origin, had derived the attributes which they had ever
      since manifested &#8212; attachment to equal laws among themselves,
      Panhellenic patriotism, and hatred of barbarians.<a

      Alluding briefly to the victories over Eumolpus and the Amazons,
      the orator passes on to the battles of Marathon, Salamis, and
      Plat&aelig;a, which he celebrates with the warmth of an Hellenic
      patriot.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_17" href="#Footnotev3_33_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a> He eulogizes the generous behaviour
      of Athens towards the Greeks, during the interval between the
      Persian and the Peloponnesian wars, contrasting it with the
      unworthy requital which she received from Sparta and others. He
      then glances at the events of the Peloponnesian wars, though
      colouring them in a manner so fanciful and delusive, that any one
      familiar with Thucydides can scarcely recognise their identity &#8212;
      especially in regard to the Athenian expedition against Syracuse.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_18" href="#Footnotev3_33_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> He protests against the faithlessness
      of Sparta, towards the close of the Peloponnesian war, in allying
      herself with the common anti-Hellenic enemy &#8212; the Great King &#8212;
      against Athens: and he ascribes mainly to this unholy alliance the
      conquest of Athens at the end of the war.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_19" href="#Footnotev3_33_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> The moderation of political parties
      in Athens, when the Thirty were put down and the democracy
      restored, receives its due meed of praise: but the peculiar merit
      claimed for Athens, in reference to the public events between 403
      <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and 387 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
      is &#8212; That she stood alone among Greeks in refusing to fraternise
      with the Persian King, or to betray to him the Asiatic Greeks.
      Athens had always been prompted by generous feeling, even in spite
      of political interests, to compassionate and befriend the weak.<a

      which years Athens had recovered her walls and her ships &#8212; had put
      down the Spartan superiority at sea &#8212; and had rescued even the
      Great King from Spartan force.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_21"

        59-184). The points touched upon in reference to Athens by
        Isokrates are in the main the same as those brought out by Plato
        in the Menexenus, only that Isokrates makes them subservient to
        a special purpose, that of bringing about an expedition against
        Persia under the joint headship of Sparta and Athens.</p>

      That this oration was much admired, not merely during the lifetime
      of Plato, but also long after his death, we know from the
      testimony of Cicero; who informs us that it was publicly recited
      every year on the day when the annual funeral rites were
      celebrated, in honour of those citizens collectively who had been
      slain in the service of their country.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_25"

      recognises the fact of such warm admiration, and concurs generally
      therein, yet not without reserves. He points out what he considers
      defects of thought and expression &#8212; ostentatious contrasts and
      balancing of antithetical clauses, after the manner of Gorgias.
      Yet we may easily believe that the harangue found much favour, and
      greatly extended the reputation of its author. It would please
      many readers who took little interest in the Sokratic dialectics.</p>

        composing it, shortly after he established himself at Athens as
        a teacher &#8212; His competition with Lysias &#8212; Desire for celebrity
        both as rhetor and as dialectician.</span></p>
    <p>
      When Plato first established himself at Athens as a lecturer
      (about 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, shortly after the
      peace made by Antalkidas), he was probably known only by Sokratic
      dialogues, properly so called: which Dionysius<span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page408" id="v3page408"></a>408</span>
      specifies both as his earliest works and as his proper department,
      wherein he stood unrivalled.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_27"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> In
      these, his opposition to the Rhetors and Sophists was proclaimed:
      and if, as is probable, the Gorgias had been published before that
      time, he had already declared war, openly as well as bitterly,
      against the whole art of Rhetoric. But it would be a double
      triumph for his genius, if, after standing forward as the
      representative of Dialectic, and in that character heaping
      scornful derision on the rival art of Rhetoric, as being nothing
      better than a mere knack of juggling and flattery<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_28" href="#Footnotev3_33_28"><span
          class="sp">28</span></a> &#8212; he were able to show that this did
      not proceed from want of rhetorical competence, but that he could
      rival or surpass the Rhetors in their own department. Herein lies
      the purpose of the Menexenus. I agree with Schleiermacher,
      Stallbaum, and some other critics,<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_29"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> in
      thinking that it was probably composed not long after the peace of
      Antalkidas, in competition with the harangue of Lysias now
      remaining on the same subject. Though the name of Lysias is not
      mentioned in the Menexenus, yet the rivalry between him and Plato
      is clearly proclaimed in the Platonic Ph&aelig;drus: and the two
      funeral harangues go so completely over the same ground, that
      intentional competition <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page409"
          id="v3page409"></a>409</span>on the part of the latest, is the

        complains of these teachers for saying in their talk with each
        other, the rhetorical teachers would vehemently complain of in
        Plato, when he expressed forcibly his contempt for rhetoric in
        the Gorgias and the Ph&aelig;drus. One way of expressing their
        resentment would be to affirm that Plato could not compose a

    <p>
      Here then we have Plato exchanging philosophy for &#8220;the knack of
      flattery&#8221; &#8212; to use the phrase of the Gorgias. Stallbaum is so
      unwilling to admit this as possible, that he represents the
      Platonic harangue as a mere caricature, intended to make the
      rhetorical process ridiculous. I dissent from this supposition; as
      I have already dissented from the like supposition of the same
      critic, in regard to the etymologies of the Kratylus. That Plato
      might in one dialogue scornfully denounce Rhetoric &#8212; and in
      another, compose an elaborate discourse upon the received
      rhetorical type &#8212; is noway inconsistent with the general theory
      which I frame to myself, about the intellectual character and
      distinct occasional manifestations of Plato.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_30" href="#Footnotev3_33_30"><span
          class="sp">30</span></a> The funeral harangue in the Menexenus
      proves that, whatever he thought about Rhetoric generally, he was
      anxious to establish his title as a competent rhetorical composer:
      it proves farther that he was equal to Lysias in the epideiktic
      department, though inferior to Perikles. It affords a valuable
      illustration of that general doctrine which the Platonic Sokrates
      lays down in the Gorgias &#8212; That no man can succeed as a rhetor,
      unless he is in full harmony of spirit and cast of mind with his
      auditors; or unless he dwells upon and enforces sympathies,
      antipathies, and convictions, already established in their minds.<a

          class="sp">31</span></a> A first-rate orator like Perikles,
      touching the chords of cherished national sentiment, might hope,
      by such a discourse as that which we read in Thucydides,
      &#8220;adjecisse aliquid recept&aelig; religioni&#8221;.<a

      the Senate to pronounce the funeral harangue, could have
      expatiated more warmly than Plato has here done, upon the
      excellence of the Athenian constitution, and upon the admirable
      spirit which had animated Athenian politics, both foreign and
      domestic. Plato falls far short, indeed, of the weight and
      grandeur, the impressive distinctness of specification, the large
      sympathies, intellectual as well as popular &#8212; with which these
      topics are handled by Perikles in Thucydides: but his eulogy is
      quite as highflown and unreserved.</p>

        This appears to me the real truth, subject to very rare
        exceptions. But I do not think it true to say, as the Platonic
        Sokrates is made to declare in the Menexenus, that it is an easy
        matter to obtain admiration when you praise Athens among
        Athenians &#8212; though Aristotle commends the observation. Assuredly
        Perikles did not think so (Thucyd. ii. 35). You have a popular
        theme, but unless you have oratorical talent to do justice to it
        you are likely to disappoint and offend, especially among
        auditors like the Athenians, accustomed to good speaking.
        Compare Plat. Kritias, p. 107 E.</p>

    <p>
      In understanding fully the Menexenus, however, we have to take
      account, not merely of the harangue which forms the bulk of it,
      but also of the conversation whereby it is commenced and
      concluded. Plato, speaking always through the mouth of Sokrates,
      has to invent some fiction excusing the employment of his master
      in the unprecedented capacity of public orator. What Stallbaum
      says (in my judgment, erroneously) about the harangue &#8212; appears to
      me perfectly true about the conversation before and after it. The
      introductory observations, interchanged between Sokrates and
      Menexenus, certainly tend to caricature (as Aristophanes<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_33" href="#Footnotev3_33_33"><span
          class="sp">33</span></a> does in the Acharneis and the
      Equites) the strong effects produced by this panegyrical oratory
      on the feelings of hearers; and to depreciate the task of the
      orator as nothing better than an easy and amusing pastime. To
      praise Athens among Athenian auditors (we are told) is a matter in
      which few speakers can fail to succeed, however poor their
      abilities. Moreover, the great funeral harangue of Perikles is
      represented as having been composed for him by Aspasia<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_33_34" href="#Footnotev3_33_34"><span
          class="sp">34</span></a> &#8212; a <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page411" id="v3page411"></a>411</span>female, though
      remarkable among her sex &#8212; who is extolled as holding the highest
      place among rhetorical teachers, and is introduced here, as
      Aristophanes introduces her in the Acharneis, when he is putting a
      construction of discreditable ridicule on the origin of the
      Peloponnesian war.<a name="FnAnchorv3_33_35"
        href="#Footnotev3_33_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> To make
      a good funeral harangue (Sokrates says) requires little or no
      preliminary preparation: besides, the Rhetors have harangues ready
      prepared at home. All this <i>persiflage</i>, in harmony with the
      polemics of the Gorgias, derides and degrades the Rhetors
      collectively. But when Plato takes the field against them as a
      competitor, in his own rhetorical discourse, he drops the ironical
      vein, and takes pains to deliver one really good and excellent in
      its kind. His triumph is thus doubled. He tells the Rhetors that
      their business is a trifling and despicable one: at the same time
      showing them that, despicable as it is, he can surpass them in it,
      as he professes to surpass Lysias in the Ph&aelig;drus.<a

        By the language of Plato here, he seems plainly to bring his own
        harangue into competition not merely with that of Lysias but
        also with that of Perikles. But we must not suppose for that
        reason, that he necessarily has in view the Periklean harangue
        which we now read in Thucydides, ii. 35-43: which is the real
        speech, reported and drest up by Thucydides in his own language
        and manner. Probably the Periklean harangue was preserved
        separately and in other reports, so that Plato may have known it
        without knowing the history of Thucydides. When I see the
        extreme liberty which Plato takes throughout his harangue in
        regard to the history of the past, I can hardly believe that he
        ever read Thucydides; if he ever read the history, he certainly
        disregarded it altogether, and threw himself &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;
        &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7970; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;: like the &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#953; of
        whom Thucydides speaks, i. 21, Lysias among them, though in a
        less degree than Plato. &AElig;schines Sokraticus had composed

        The remarks of Dionysius of Halikarnassus (in the Epistle to Cn.
        Pompey about Plato, pp. 754-758) are well deserving of
        attention: especially as he had before him many writers now
        lost, either contemporary with Plato or of the succeeding
        generation. He notices not only Plato&#8217;s asperity in ridiculing
        most of his distinguished contemporaries, but also his marked
        rivalry against Lysias.</p>

    <p>
      Such I conceive to be the scope of the dialogue, looked at from
      Plato&#8217;s point of view. In order to find a person suitable in point
      of age to be described as the teacher of Sokrates, he is forced to
      go back to the past generation &#8212; that of Perikles and Aspasia. But
      though he avoids anachronism on this point, he cannot avoid the
      anachronism of making Sokrates allude to events long posterior to
      his own death. This anachronism is real, though it has been
      magnified by some critics into a graver defect than it is in
      truth. Plato was resolved not to speak in his own person, but
      through that of Sokrates. But he is not always <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page412" id="v3page412"></a>412</span>careful
      to keep within the limits which consistent adherence to such a

        Groen van Prinsterer (Prosopographia Platonica, p. 211 seq.)
        adverts to the carelessness of Plato about exact chronology.</p>
      <p>
        Most of the Platonic critics recognise the Menexenus as a
        genuine Platonic dialogue. Ast, however, includes it among the
        numerous dialogues which he disallows as spurious; and Suckow,
        Steinhart, and Ueberweg, are also inclined to disallow it. See
        Ueberweg, Die Aechtheit der Platonischen Schriften, pp. 143-148.
        These critics make light of the allusion of Aristotle in the
        Rhetoric &#8212; &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#943;&#8179; &#8212; which appears to me, I
        confess, of more weight than all the grounds of suspicion
        adduced by them to prove the dialogue spurious. The presumption
        in favour of the catalogue of Thrasyllus counts with them, here
        as elsewhere, for nothing.</p>

    <p>
      The Kleitophon is an unfinished fragment, beginning with a short
      introductory conversation between Sokrates and Kleitophon, and
      finishing with a discourse of some length, a sort of remonstrance
      or appeal, addressed by Kleitophon to Sokrates; who makes no
      reply.</p>
    <p>
      Some one was lately telling me (says Sokrates) that Kleitophon, in
      conversation with Lysias, depreciated the conversation of
      Sokrates, and extolled prodigiously that of Thrasymachus.</p>

    <p>
      Whoever told you so (replies Kleitophon), did not report
      accurately what I said. On some points, indeed, I did not praise
      you; but on other points I did praise you. Since, however, you are
      evidently displeased with me, though you affect indifference &#8212; and
      since we are here alone &#8212; I should be glad to repeat the same
      observations to yourself, in order that you may not believe me to
      think meanly of you. These incorrect reports seem to have made you
      displeased with me, more than is reasonable. I am anxious to speak
      to you with full freedom, if you will allow it.<a

      It would be a shame indeed (rejoined Sokrates), if, when you were
      anxious to do me good, I could not endure to receive it. When I
      have learnt which are my worst and which are my best points, I
      shall evidently be in a condition to cultivate and pursue the
      latter and resolutely to avoid the former.</p>

    <p>
      As your frequent companion, Sokrates, I have often listened to you
      with profound admiration. I thought you superior to all other
      speakers when you proclaimed your usual strain of reproof, like
      the God from a dramatic machine, against mankind.<a

      You asked them, &#8220;Whither are you drifting, my friends? You do not
      seem aware that you are doing wrong when you place all your
      affections on the gain of money, and neglect to teach your sons
      and heirs the right use of money. You do not provide for them
      teachers of justice, if justice be teachable; nor trainers of it,
      if it be acquirable by training and habit; nor indeed have you
      studied the acquisition of it, even for yourselves. Since the fact
      is obvious that, while you, as well as your sons, have learnt what
      passes for a finished education in virtue (letters, music,
      gymnastic), you nevertheless yield to the corruptions of gain &#8212;
      how comes it that you do not despise your actual education, and
      look out for teachers to correct such disorder? It is this
      disorder, not the want of accomplishment in the use of the lyre,
      which occasions such terrible discord, and such calamitous war,
      between brother and brother &#8212; between city and city.<a

      You affirm that men do wrong wilfully, not from ignorance or want
      of training: yet nevertheless you are bold enough to say, that
      wrong-doing is dishonourable and offensive to the Gods. How can
      any one, then, choose such an evil willingly? You tell us it is
      because he is overcome by pleasures: well then, that again comes
      to unwillingness &#8212; if victory be the thing which every man wishes:
      so that, whichever way you turn it, reason shows you that
      wrong-doing is taken up unwillingly, and that greater precautions
      ought to be taken upon the subject, both by individuals and by

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_4"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_4"></a>The observations made by Sokrates
        have been most salutary and stimulating in awakening ardour for
        virtue. Arguments and analogies commonly used by Sokrates.</span></p>
    <p>
      Such, Sokrates (continues Kleitophon), is the language which <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page415" id="v3page415"></a>415</span>I
      often hear from you; and which I always hear with the strongest
      and most respectful admiration. You follow it up by observing,
      that those who train their bodies and neglect their minds, commit
      the mistake of busying themselves about the subordinate and
      neglecting the superior. You farther remark, that if a man does
      not know how to use any object rightly, he had better abstain from
      using it altogether: if he does not know how to use his eyes, his
      ears, or his body &#8212; it will be better for him neither to see, nor
      to hear, nor to use his body at all: the like with any instrument
      or article of property &#8212; for whoever cannot use his own lyre well,
      cannot use his neighbour&#8217;s lyre better. Out of these premisses you
      bring out forcibly the conclusion &#8212; That if a man does not know
      how to use his mind rightly, it is better for him to make no use
      of it:&#8212; better for him not to live, than to live under his own
      direction. If he must live, he had better live as a slave than a
      freeman, surrendering the guidance of his understanding to some
      one else who knows the art of piloting men: which art you,
      Sokrates, denominate often the political art, sometimes the
      judicial art or justice.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_5"

      These discourses of yours, alike numerous and admirable &#8212; showing

      entreat both from Sokrates and from each other, an answer to the

        with this view, both to the companions of Sokrates and to
        Sokrates himself.</span></p>
    <p>
      The ablest of your companions answered me (continues Kleitophon),
      that the art to which you were wont to allude was no other than
      Justice itself. I told him in reply &#8212; Do not give me the mere
      name, but tell me what Justice is.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_8"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> In the
      medical art there are two distinct results contemplated and
      achieved: one, that of keeping up the succession of competent
      physicians &#8212; another that of conferring or preserving health: this
      last, <i>Health</i>, is not the art itself, but the work
      accomplished by the art. Just so, the builder&#8217;s art, has for its
      object the <i>house</i>, which is its work &#8212; and the keeping up
      the continuity of builders, which is its teaching. Tell me in the
      same manner respecting the art called Justice. Its teaching
      province is plain enough &#8212; to maintain the succession of just men:
      but what is its working province? what is the work which the just
      man does for us?</p>

        Sokrates unsatisfactory.</span></p>
    <p>To this question your friend replied (explaining Justice) &#8212; it is
      The Advantageous. Another man near him said, The Proper: a third
      said, The Profitable: a fourth, The Gainful.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_34_9" href="#Footnotev3_34_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
      I pursued the inquiry by observing, that these were general names
      equally applicable in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page417"
          id="v3page417"></a>417</span>other arts, and to something
      different in each. Every art aims at what is proper, advantageous,
      profitable, gainful, in its own separate department: but each can
      farther describe to you what that department is. Thus the art of
      the carpenter is, to perform well, properly, advantageously,
      profitably, &amp;c., in the construction of wooden implements,
      &amp;c. That is the special work of the carpenter&#8217;s art: now tell
      me, what is the special work, corresponding thereunto, of the art
      called Justice?</p>

      At this stage of our conversation the hearers themselves felt
      perplexed, and interfered to remonstrate with him; observing, that
      the debate had come round to the same point again. They declared
      that the medical art also was harmony of reason and intelligence:
      that the like was true besides of every other art: that each of
      them could define the special end to which it tended: but that as
      to that art, or that harmony of reason and intelligence, which had
      been called Justice, no one could see to what purpose it tended,
      nor what was its special work.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_12"

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_9"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_9"></a>Kleitophon at length asked the
        question from Sokrates himself. But Sokrates did not answer
        clearly. Kleitophon believes that Sokrates knows, but will not
        tell.</span></p>
    <p>
      After all this debate (continues Kleitophon) I addressed the same
      question to yourself, Sokrates &#8212; What is Justice? You answered &#8212;
      To do good to friends, hurt to enemies. <span class="pagenum"><a
          name="v3page418" id="v3page418"></a>418</span>But presently it
      appeared, that the just man would never, on any occasion, do hurt
      to any one:&#8212; that he would act towards every one with a view to
      good. It is not once, nor twice, but often and often, that I have
      endured these perplexities, and have importuned you to clear them
      up.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_13" href="#Footnotev3_34_13"><span
          class="sp">13</span></a> At last I am wearied out, and have
      come to the conviction that you are doubtless a consummate
      proficient in the art of stimulating men to seek virtue; but that
      as to the ulterior question, how they are to find it &#8212; you either
      do not know, or you will not tell. In regard to any art (such as
      steersmanship or others), there may be persons who can extol and
      recommend the art to esteem, but cannot direct the hearers how to
      acquire it: and in like manner a man might remark about you, that
      you do not know any better what Justice is, because you are a
      proficient in commending it. For my part, such is not my opinion.
      I think that you know, but have declined to tell me. I am
      resolved, in my present embarrassment, to go to Thrasymachus, or
      any one else that I can find to help me; unless you will consent
      to give me something more than these merely stimulating
      discourses.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_14" href="#Footnotev3_34_14"><span
          class="sp">14</span></a> Consider me as one upon whom your
      stimulus has already told. If the question were about gymnastic,
      as soon as I had become fully stimulated to attend to my bodily
      condition, you would have given me, as a sequel to your
      stimulating discourse, some positive direction, what my body was
      by nature, and what treatment it required. Deal in like manner
      with the case before us: reckon Kleitophon as one fully agreeing
      with you, that it is contemptible to spend so much energy upon
      other objects, and to neglect our minds, with a view to which all
      other objects are treasured up. Put me down as having already
      given my adhesion to all these views of yours.</p>

          id="Sidenotev3_34_11"></a>Remarks on the Kleitophon. Why
        Thrasyllus placed it in the eighth Tetralogy immediately before
        the Republic, and along with Kritias, the other fragment.</span></p>
    <p>
      The fragment called Kleitophon (of which I have given an abstract
      comparatively long), is in several ways remarkable. The
      Thrasyllean catalogue places it first in the eighth Tetralogy; the
      three other members of the same Tetralogy being, Republic,
      Tim&aelig;us, Kritias.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_16"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Though
      it is both short, and abrupt in its close, we know that it was so
      likewise in antiquity: the ancient Platonic commentators
      observing, that Sokrates disdained to make any reply to the appeal
      of Kleitophon.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_17" href="#Footnotev3_34_17"><span
          class="sp">17</span></a> There were therefore in this
      Tetralogy two fragments, unfinished works from the beginning &#8212;
      Kleitophon and Kritias.</p>

        M. Boeckh observes (ad Platonis Minoem, p. 11):&#8212; &#8220;Nec minus
        falsum est, quod <i>spurium</i> Clitophontem plerique omnes
        mutilatum putant; quem ex auctoris manibus truncum excidisse
        inde intelligitur, quod ne vetusti quidem Platonici philosophi,
        quibus antiquissima exemplaria ad manum erant, habuerunt
        integriorem. Proclus in Tim&aelig;, i. p. 7. &#928;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#8001;

        Plan&eacute; ut in Criti&acirc;, quem ab ipso Platone non
        absolutum docet Plutarchus in Solone.&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        M. Boeckh here characterises the Kleitophon as <i>spurious</i>,
        in which opinion I do not concur.</p>
      <p>
        Yxem, in his Dissertation, Ueber Platon&#8217;s Kleitophon, Berlin,
        1846, has vindicated the genuineness of this dialogue, though
        many of his arguments are such as I cannot subscribe to.</p>
      <p>
        He shows farther, that the first idea of distrusting the
        genuineness of the Kleitophon arose from the fact that the
        dialogue was printed in the Aldine edition of 1513, along with
        the spurious dialogues; although in that very Aldine edition the
        editors expressly announce that this was a mistake, and that the
        dialogue ought to have been printed as first of the eighth
        tetralogy. See Yxem, pp. 32-33. Subsequent editors followed the
        Aldine in printing the dialogue among the spurious, though still
        declaring that they did not consider it spurious.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We may explain why Thrasyllus placed the Kleitophon in immediate
      antecedence to the Republic: because 1. It complains <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page420" id="v3page420"></a>420</span>bitterly
      of the want of a good explanation of Justice, which Sokrates in
      the latter books of the Republic professes to furnish. 2. It
      brings before us Kleitophon, who announces an inclination to
      consult Thrasymachus: now both these personages appear in the
      first book of the Republic, in which too Thrasymachus is
      introduced as disputing in a brutal and insulting way, and as
      humiliated by Sokrates: so that the Republic might be considered
      both as an answer to the challenge of the Kleitophon, and as a
      reproof to Kleitophon himself for having threatened to quit
      Sokrates and go to Thrasymachus.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_12"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_12"></a>Kleitophon is genuine, and perfectly
        in harmony with a just theory of Plato.</span></p>
    <p>
      Like so many other pieces in the Thrasyllean catalogue, the
      Kleitophon has been declared to be spurious by Schleiermacher and
      other critics of the present century. I see no ground for this
      opinion, and I believe the dialogue to be genuine. If it be asked,
      how can we imagine Plato to have composed a polemic argument, both
      powerful and unanswered, against Sokrates, &#8212; I reply, that this is
      not so surprising as the Parmenid&ecirc;s: in which Plato has
      introduced the veteran so named as the successful assailant not
      only of Sokrates, but of the Platonic theory of Ideas defended by
      Sokrates.</p>
    <p>
      I have already declared, that the character of Plato is, in my
      judgment, essentially many-sided. It comprehends the whole process
      of searching for truth, and testing all that is propounded as
      such: it does not shrink from broaching and developing speculative
      views not merely various and distinct, but sometimes even
      opposite.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_13"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_13"></a>It could not have been published
        until after Plato&#8217;s death.</span></p>
    <p>
      Yet though the Kleitophon is Plato&#8217;s work, it is a sketch or
      fragment never worked out. In its present condition, it can hardly
      have been published (any more than the Kritias) either by his
      direction or during his life. I conceive it to have remained among
      his papers, to have been made known by his school after his death,
      and to have passed from thence among the other Platonic
      manuscripts into the Alexandrian library at its first foundation.
      Possibly it may have been originally intended as a preparation for
      the solution of that problem, which Sokrates afterwards undertakes
      in the Republic: for it is a challenge to Sokrates to explain what
      he means by Justice. It may have been intended <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page421" id="v3page421"></a>421</span>as
      such, but never prosecuted:&#8212; the preparation for that solution
      being provided in another way, such as we now read in the first
      and second books of the Republic. That the great works of Plato &#8212;
      Republic, Protagoras, Symposion, &amp;c. &#8212; could not have been
      completed without preliminary sketches and tentatives &#8212; we may
      regard as certain. That some of these sketches, though never
      worked up, and never published by Plato himself, should have been
      good enough to be preserved by him and published by those who
      succeeded him &#8212; is at the very least highly probable. One such is
      the Kleitophon.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_14"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_14"></a>Reasons why the Kleitophon was never
        finished. It points out the defects of Sokrates, just as he
        himself confesses them in the Apology.</span></p>
    <p>
      When I read the Kleitophon, I am not at all surprised that Plato
      never brought it to a conclusion, nor ever provided Sokrates with
      an answer to the respectful, yet emphatic, requisition of
      Kleitophon. The case against Sokrates has been made so strong,
      that I doubt whether Plato himself could have answered it to his
      own satisfaction. It resembles the objections which he advances in
      the Parmenid&ecirc;s against the theory of Ideas: objections which
      he has nowhere answered, and which I do not believe that he could
      answer. The characteristic attribute of which Kleitophon complains
      in Sokrates is, that of a one-sided and incomplete efficiency &#8212;
      (&#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#972;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#962;) &#8212; &#8220;You are perpetually stirring us up and
      instigating us: you do this most admirably: but when we have
      become full of fervour, you do not teach us how we are to act, nor
      point out the goal towards which we are to move&#8221;.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_34_18" href="#Footnotev3_34_18"><span
          class="sp">18</span></a> Now this is precisely the description
      which Sokrates gives of his own efficiency, in the Platonic
      Apology addressed to the Dikasts. He lays especial stress on the
      mission imposed upon him by the Gods, to apply his Elenchus in
      testing and convicting the false persuasion of knowledge
      universally prevalent:&#8212; to make sure by repeated
      cross-examination, whether the citizens pursued money and worldly
      advancement more energetically than virtue:&#8212; and to worry the
      Athenians with perpetual stimulus, like the gadfly exciting a
      high-bred but lethargic horse. Sokrates describes this <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page422" id="v3page422"></a>422</span>not
      only as the mission of his life, but as a signal benefit and
      privilege conferred upon Athens by the Gods.<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_34_19" href="#Footnotev3_34_19"><span
          class="sp">19</span></a> But here his services end. He
      declares explicitly that he shares in the universal ignorance, and
      that he is no wiser than any one else, except in being aware of
      his own ignorance. He disclaims all power of teaching:<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_34_20" href="#Footnotev3_34_20"><span
          class="sp">20</span></a> and he deprecates the supposition, &#8212;
      that he himself knew what he convicted others of not knowing, &#8212; as
      a mistake which had brought upon him alike unmerited reputation
      and great unpopularity.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_21"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> We find
      thus that the description given by Sokrates of himself in the
      Apology, and the reproach addressed to Sokrates by Kleitophon,
      fully coincide. &#8220;My mission from the Gods&#8221; (says Sokrates), &#8220;is to
      dispel the false persuasion of knowledge, to cross-examine men
      into a painful conviction of their own ignorance, and to create in
      them a lively impulse towards knowledge and virtue: but I am no
      wiser than they: I can teach them nothing, nor can I direct them
      what to do.&#8221; &#8212; That is exactly what I complain of (remarks
      Kleitophon): I have gone through your course, &#8212; have been
      electrified by your Elenchus, &#8212; and am full of the impulse which
      you so admirably communicate. In this condition, what I require
      is, to find out how, or in which direction I am to employ that
      impulse. If you cannot tell me, I must ask Thrasymachus or some
      one else.</p>

    <p>
      Moreover, it is not merely in the declarations of Sokrates himself
      before the Athenian Dikasts, but also in the Platonic Sokrates as
      exhibited by Plato in very many of his dialogues, that the same
      efficiency, and the same deficiency, stand conspicuous. The hearer
      is convicted of ignorance, on some familiar subject which he
      believed himself to know: the protreptic stimulus is powerful,
      stinging his mind into uneasiness which he cannot appease except
      by finding some tenable result: but the didactic supplement is not
      forthcoming. Sokrates ends by creating a painful feeling of
      perplexity in the hearers, but he himself shares <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page423" id="v3page423"></a>423</span>the
      feeling along with them. &#8212; It is this which the youth Protarchus
      deprecates, at the beginning of the Platonic Phil&ecirc;bus;<a
        name="FnAnchorv3_34_22" href="#Footnotev3_34_22"><span
          class="sp">22</span></a> and with which Hippias taunts

        name="FnAnchorv3_34_23" href="#Footnotev3_34_23"><span
          class="sp">23</span></a> &#8212; insomuch that Sokrates replies to
      the taunt by giving a definition of the Just (&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;), upon
      which Hippias comments. But if the observations ascribed by
      Xenophon to Hippias are a report of what that Sophist really said,
      we only see how inferior he was to Sokrates in the art of
      cross-questioning: for the definition given by Sokrates would have
      been found altogether untenable, if there had been any second
      Sokrates to apply the Elenchus to it.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_24"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Lastly,
      Xenophon expressly tells us, that there were others also, who,

        which these defects are set forth in the Kleitophon. Impossible
        to answer them in such a way as to hold out against the negative
        Elenchus of a Sokratic pupil.</span></p>
    <p>
      The Platonic Kleitophon corresponds, in a great degree, to these
      complaints of Protarchus and others, as well as to the taunt of
      Hippias. The case is put, however, with much greater force and
      emphasis: as looked at, not by an opponent and outsider, like
      Hippias &#8212; nor by a mere novice, unarmed though eager, like
      Protarchus &#8212; but by a companion of long standing, who has gone
      through the full course of negative gymnastic, is grateful for the
      benefit derived, and feels that it is time to pass from the lesser
      mysteries to the greater. He is sick of perpetual negation and
      stimulus: he demands doctrines and explanations, which will hold
      good against the negative Elenchus of Sokrates himself. But this
      is exactly what Sokrates cannot give. His mission from the
      Delphian God finishes with the negative: inspiration fails him
      when he deals with the affirmative. He is like the gadfly (his own
      simile) in stimulating <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page424"
          id="v3page424"></a>424</span>the horse &#8212; and also in
      furnishing no direction how the stimulus is to be expended. His
      affirmative dicta, &#8212; as given in the Xenophontic Memorabilia, are
      for the most part plain, home-bred, good sense, &#8212; in which all the
      philosophical questions are slurred over, and the undefined words,
      Justice, Temperance, Holiness, Courage, Law, &amp;c., are assumed
      to have a settled meaning agreed to by every one: while as given
      by Plato, in the Republic and elsewhere, they are more
      speculative, highflown, and poetical,<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_26"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> but not
      the less exposed to certain demolition, if the batteries of the
      Sokratic Elenchus were brought to bear upon them. The challenge of
      Kleitophon is thus unanswerable. It brings out in the most
      forcible, yet respectful, manner the contrast between the two
      attributes of the Sokratic mind: in the negative, irresistible
      force and originality: in the affirmative, confessed barrenness
      alternating with honest, acute, practical sense, but not
      philosophy. Instead of this, Plato gives us transcendental
      hypotheses, and a religious and poetical ideal; impressive indeed
      to the feelings, but equally inadmissible to a mind trained in the
      use of the Sokratic tests.</p>

        The explanation of Justice given by Plato in the Republic
        deserves to be described much in the same words as Sokrates
        employs (Repub. i. p. 332 C) in characterising the definition of

        and Plato.</span></p>
    <p>
      We may thus see sufficient reason why Plato, after having drawn up
      the Kleitophon as preparatory basis for a dialogue, became
      unwilling to work it out, and left it as an unfinished sketch. He
      had, probably without intending it, made out too strong a case
      against Sokrates and against himself. If he continued it, he would
      have been obliged to put some sufficient reason into the mouth of
      Sokrates, why Kleitophon should abandon his intention of
      frequenting some other teacher: and this was a hard task. He would
      have been obliged to lay before Kleitophon, a pupil thoroughly
      inoculated with his own negative <i>&#339;strus</i>, affirmative
      solutions proof against such subtle cross-examination: and this,
      we may fairly assume, was not merely a hard task, but impossible.
      Hence it is that we possess the Kleitophon only as a fragment.</p>

      <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev3_34_18"
          id="Sidenotev3_34_18"></a>The Kleitophon was originally

    <p>
      Yet I think it a very ingenious and instructive fragment: <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="v3page425" id="v3page425"></a>425</span>setting
      forth powerfully, in respect to the negative philosophy of
      Sokrates and Plato, a point of view which must have been held by
      many intelligent contemporaries. Among all the objections urged
      against Sokrates and Plato, probably none was more frequent than
      this protest against the continued negative procedure. This same
      point of view &#8212; that Sokrates puzzled every one, but taught no one
      any thing &#8212; is reproduced by Thrasymachus against Sokrates in the
      first book of the Republic:<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_27"
        href="#Footnotev3_34_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> in which
      first book there are various other marks of analogy with the
      Kleitophon.<a name="FnAnchorv3_34_28" href="#Footnotev3_34_28"><span
          class="sp">28</span></a> It might seem as if Plato had in the
      first instance projected a dialogue in which Sokrates was to
      discuss the subject of justice, and had drawn up the Kleitophon as
      the sketch of a sort of forcing process to be applied to Sokrates:
      then, finding that he placed Sokrates under too severe pressure,
      had abandoned the project, and taken up the same subject anew, in
      the manner which we now read in the Republic. The task which he
      assigns to Sokrates, in this last-mentioned dialogue, is far
      easier. Instead of the appeal made to Sokrates by Kleitophon, with
      truly Sokratic point &#8212; we have an assault made upon him by
      Thrasymachus, alike angry, impudent and feeble; which just elicits
      the peculiar aptitude of Sokrates for humbling the boastful
      affirmer. Again in the second book, Glaukon and Adeimantus are
      introduced as stating the difficulties which they feel in respect
      to the theory of Justice: but in a manner totally different from
      Kleitophon, and without any reference to previous Sokratic
      requirements. Each of them delivers an eloquent and forcible
      pleading, in the manner of an Aristotelian or Ciceronian dialogue:
      and to this Sokrates makes his reply. In that reply, Sokrates
      explains what he means by Justice: and though his exposition is
      given in the form of short questions, each followed by an answer
      of acquiescence, yet no <span class="pagenum"><a name="v3page426"
          id="v3page426"></a>426</span>real or serious objections are
      made to him throughout the whole. The case must have been very
      different if Plato had continued the dialogue Kleitophon; so as to
      make Sokrates explain the theory of Justice, in the face of all
      the objections raised by a Sokratic cross-examiner.<a

      <p>
        These are exactly the unsatisfactory definitions which
        Kleitophon describes himself (p. 409 C) as having received from

        Schleiermacher (Einleitung, v. pp. 453-455) considers the
        Kleitophon not to be the work of Plato. But this only shows that
        he, like many other critics, attaches scarcely the smallest
        importance to the presumption arising from the Canon of
        Thrasyllus. For the grounds by which he justifies his
        disallowance of the dialogue are to the last degree trivial.</p>
      <p>
        I note with surprise one of his assertions: &#8220;How&#8221; (he asks) &#8220;or
        from what motive can Plato have introduced an attack upon
        Sokrates, which is thoroughly repelled, both seriously and
        ironically, in almost all the Platonic dialogues?&#8221;</p>
      <p>
        As I read Plato, on the contrary: the Truth is, That it is
        repelled in none, confirmed in many, and thoroughly ratified by
        Sokrates himself in the Platonic Apology.</p>
      <p>
        Schleiermacher thinks that the Kleitophon is an attack upon
        Sokrates and the Sokratic men, Plato included, made by some
        opponent out of the best rhetorical schools. He calls it &#8220;a
        parody and caricature&#8221; of the Sokratic manner. To me it seems no
        caricature at all. It is a very fair application of the Sokratic
        or Platonic manner. Nor is it conceived by any means in the
        spirit of an enemy, but in that of an established companion,
        respectful and grateful, yet dissatisfied at finding that he
        makes no progress.</p>

   <h4>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</h4>
   <p>This HTML version was prepared initially for the on-line Grote Project by Ed Brandon from volumes in the Internet Archive. It owes a very great deal (its style sheet) to the Project Gutenberg versions of the 1911 <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> produced by Don Kretz and others. Don provided a revised style for the side-notes to accommodate Grote&rsquo;s predilection for very long notes. (Even so there are a few occasions where the appearance may yet be bad in some browsers because the side-note extends over more lines than its accompanying paragraph. If there are also footnotes in the paragraph I have had to guess at how much blank space should be inserted for the footnote not to overlap the side-note.) I have modified it in one respect to permit Grote&rsquo;s use of italics in some side-notes.</p>
